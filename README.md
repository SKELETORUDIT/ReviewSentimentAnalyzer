## Overview
The Sentiment Analysis Toolkit provides a comprehensive suite for processing, analyzing, and visualizing sentiment data from customer reviews. Using advanced machine learning techniques, this toolkit categorizes text into Positive, Neutral, or Negative sentiments, aiding businesses in understanding customer feedback.

## Features
- **Automated Text Processing**: Leverage advanced NLP techniques for text cleaning and preparation.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Utilize a pre-trained model to classify sentiments effectively.
- **Interactive GUI**: Engage with an intuitive graphical user interface for real-time sentiment analysis.
- **Visual Analytics**: View sentiment results graphically with matplotlib, enhancing data interpretation.
- **Scalable and Modular**: Easily adaptable codebase for further expansion or modification.

## Project Structure
```plaintext
├── sentiment_analysis.py      # Core script for training the sentiment model
├── sentiment_gui.py           # GUI application for displaying sentiment analysis results
├── visualize_sentiment.py     # Visualization script for sentiment outcomes
├── customer_reviews.csv       # Dataset of customer reviews
├── sentiment_model.pkl        # Saved sentiment analysis model
└── vectorizer.pkl             # Saved TF-IDF vectorizer
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, NLTK, spaCy, imblearn, TextBlob, matplotlib, tkinter, Pillow

### Installation
Install all dependencies with pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk spacy imblearn textblob matplotlib pillow
```
Download necessary NLTK and spaCy data:
```bash
python -m nltk.downloader punkt stopwords wordnet
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Usage
- **Model Training**: Execute `sentiment_analysis.py` to train and save the sentiment model and vectorizer.
- **GUI Application**: Run `sentiment_gui.py` to start the GUI, review sentiments, and display corresponding emojis.
- **Data Visualization**: Use `visualize_sentiment.py` to visually represent sentiment analysis results.
