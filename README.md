## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, NLTK, spaCy, imblearn, TextBlob, matplotlib, tkinter, Pillow

### Installation
Install all dependencies with pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk spacy imblearn textblob matplotlib pillow
```
Download necessary NLTK and spaCy data:
```bash
python -m nltk.downloader punkt stopwords wordnet
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Usage
- **Model Training**: Execute `sentiment_analysis.py` to train and save the sentiment model and vectorizer.
- **GUI Application**: Run `sentiment_gui.py` to start the GUI, review sentiments, and display corresponding emojis.
- **Data Visualization**: Use `visualize_sentiment.py` to visually represent sentiment analysis results.
