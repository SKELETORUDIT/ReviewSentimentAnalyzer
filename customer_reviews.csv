65663,B001BM3ON6,Great broth at a great price,"This is one of the very few broths that doesn't have MSG as a hidden ingredient. Sometimes they hide it as yeast extract. They can even hide it in the ""natural flavor"" category. This is just broth, the way it should be."
78105,B0011664YS,Very poor quality,"My husband and I love Cella's chocolate-covered cherries and I've ordered them many times from Amazon, but each time used a different seller. This batch is awful. The chocolate is melted not crisp, the bottoms of each piece looks as if a thumb has pushed them up and there doesn't appear to be any liquid center. Some of the pieces are sticky, too. I will never use this seller again. I wasted my money and that makes me angry."
39040,B001LQTCQA,I feel cheated,"I ordered this item as a gift for me dear friend. But unfortunately, Amazon has put the WRONG PICTURE on this item. I ordered this thinking that I would receive brown sugar, as pictured, but instead was very angry and disappointed to find a BLUE box of WHITE sugar. Not brown. And since this is a grocery item, I'm not even allowed to return the product that I never wanted to begin with. This is very unsatisfying, coming from Amazon itself. Very unprofessional. And this is after I went out of my way to promote Amazon to everyone I knew, raving about how fantastic it was, just to be met with a large amount of disappointment. VERY ANGRY."
9253,B006N3IG4K,One of my favorites!,"I have had all of the various Keurigs since they came on the market for home use. Thus,I have tried pretty near all of the various k-cups. This is one of my top 5 favorites. Love the coconut in it, and the wonderful coffee flavor. YUM!!!!"

60598,B003QNJYXM,Great Energy Booster,"I was not sure this product would live up to the ads, but it gave me the energy boost I needed when I needed it when I had to work the overnight shift."
72857,B000FPGZFY,added fish oil to this for a BABY??,I am not happy with Gerber at all.  I researched their products and they do not have to list ingredients if below a certain percentage.  (LIKE IF GREEN BEANS WERE MADE ON A CONVEYER OF WHERE RICE WAS MADE AND THE RICE WAS UNDER A CERTAIN AMOUNT TRACED THEY DO NOT LIST IT ON THE INGREDIENTS).  The beans I did not know have fish oil in it.  It is now listed on the product ingredients.
314925,B000ANQQQO,"Mostly clover, Only 8% broccoli","Even its label printed it contained only 8% broccoli, 66% clover.  That's about how it sprouted too.  NOT how it was advertised."
3343,B005K4Q1VI,FAVORITE HOT COCOA!,"This is the absolute best hot cocoa for the Keurig Brewers. All of the other Hot Cocoa's that we have tried we had to ""doctor"" to make them taste good. We had to add more cocoa and more sugar. I was pretty much making my own cocoa, which defeated the purpose of the brewer. But the Grove Square Hot Cocoa does not need any help. In my opinion, It has just the right amount of flavor!!"
151800,B00315WGNK,Great product for the money.,I used to buy Beef Jerky from the local store. But this is heaven woow that is it. Recomend this product to anyone.
294520,B003WMA8WI,my dog didn't like them,My dog wouldn't eat these and neither would my daughter's two dogs.  I don't know what it is about the flavor but they didn't like them.
5985,B00063480O,Best Treats Ever!,"Old Mother Hubbard treats are the best and at a reasonable price. Their treats come in a lot of different sizes and flavors. They offer a variety of products that all dogs will love. My three black labs love the peanut butter and Bac'N""Cheez."
8256,B000E15DFM,"Bit salty, but otherwise excellent.","I'm not a huge fan of salt, so take that warning with a grain of, well... you know.  For most people the salt on these is probably fine.  They stay crispy over long periods of storage, even after the package has been opened and split into tupperware containers, they're reasonably sturdy, they pair well with all but the saltiest cheeses (wouldn't put blues on them), they pair GREAT with unsalted pb... just a great all-around cracker to keep in the house.  They've become a staple of my diet and, unlike every other cracker I've bought in bulk, and there have been many, they haven't developed some weird off-flavor due to over-familiarization or the cracker becoming stale.  They still taste good, like a simple cracker.  I'll be ordering them again!"
59640,B000W5SLB8,flatus,this dog food caused the most horrible gas my dogs have ever had.  I changed dog food and the gas is gone.  Would never give this to my dogs again.
553883,B000PEDTSQ,Great on Popcorn,That is what we use it for. We even take it to the movie Theatre.
5079,B005H3BYHI,not even close to coconut water!,"Coconut water should not be sweetened!!! Actually ""NO SUGAR SHOULD EVER BE ADDED"" sweeting things is an american custom, which ruins the real flavor of coconut water. I lived in Jamaica for 4 years and the bahamas for 2, and the coconut water from real coconut does not have any added sugar, its natural.<br />I will stick to buying the brown hard shell coconuts from the supermarket and drink that it's more natural and unaltered. These boxed, caned and packaged coconut water are nasty, i am still yet to try a brand, one of the many that i have tried that will make me wanna buy it."
38844,B000ICO8GW,switched to Starbucks,"The Gevalia coffees are a little weak for my taste, so I switched to all Starbucks House Blend and Africa Kitamu."
179,B0025VRCJY,ReaLemon Juice from Amazon.,"This is not as good as the Frozen Lemon juice, but it is good. It has a slightly odd flavor, perhaps from a preservative. Sure wish I could order the frozen juice!"
465245,B000FSRN7U,What real jerky taste like,S what if it is salty it is jerky.  Just eat a few pieces when you are out for a hike and drink your water.  No need to eat a whole bag at once and OD on the salt
526686,B007PA30TG,joe-74,"didn't get ,quite the taste i wanted,brought thru amazon. but overall will still keep using this product,until it runs out."
531,B000G6RYNE,Great deal,These Backyard BBQ Kettle Chips were a great deal with the promo code.  It was nice to have a larger size bag.  Some Kettle Chips in the grocery store are only about 5 ounces and we polish them off in one family lunch!  They arrived fresh and were not in crumbles as some other chips from Amazon Grocery have been.  Great flavor and All Natural!
6030,B001E2FMLK,Ridiculous price,The advertised regular price of $99.99 is ridiculous.  5 hour energy drinks are widely available for $2.00 each.  Don't buy from sellers who inflate prices and charge ridiculous amounts.  You can get a case of 12 for $20 right here on Amazon.
6377,B000N9HXZ8,Very Very Good,"I'm so glad to shop at Amazon.com it have everything you need,I<br />love getting my season from ""Marshalls Creek Spices"" it fresh, and<br />taste, and good try it you will like it I'm so glad to know about<br />amazon.com I wouldn't know about ""Marshalls Creek Spices""<br /><br />  Thank You<br />  Miss Andernette Anderson<br />  God Bless"
324160,B000JMDJ5C,spice,"Since there wasn't any ingredient listing, I didn't know I couldn't use it until it arrived. I am gluten free...sorry!"
30424,B0017L3NBE,Sunflower seeds without shells,This is a lot of standard seeds not bad but not great either. And too many to bother eating them all before they will go bad Oh well
425323,B003GAJF4S,very good rice,I buy this from Amazon because our local grocery stores do not carry any form of this rice. Just do not overcook this. I tried it in a rice cooker so it would be done when I came back home. It was way overdone -  just follow directions on the box.
241844,B0081XPTBS,"If you've got to use formula, use this one",Our baby likes this formula and we like that it's organic.  We use one bottle a day at bedtime to give her a boost of iron and DHA/ARA.
43451,B001EQ4P2I,Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack?,"These almonds are very tasty and popular at my workplace. If you've had wasabi peas, you'll probably like these too. ""BOLD"" is a bit of an overstatement, as these almonds are not as intense as the peas with the nasal burn, but still do have a bit of kick. I wouldn't say the soy sauce flavor is that apparent, though, but I'm not counting that against the product.<br /><br />Most wasabi-flavored snacks really contain horseradish because it is a cheaper substitute. Wasabi is notoriously difficult to cultivate and the chemicals that give it its characteristic pungency are volatile.<br /><br />I like these a whole lot and routinely buy several cans of them from my drugstore whenever they are on sale. My mom's factory wo-workers like these too. However, I took this to a baseball game and it was almost universally hated. Go figure!"
6904,B001LG945O,"Questionable ""healthy"" drink...","Unlike another product I reviewed for Vine, at least this product does not have sugar per se in it. It is carbonated water added to a concentrate mixture of (in this order): apple, grape, tangerine and last - as well as least -- acai concentrate. The first two on the list, apple and grape are two of the most common ""fruit"" sweeteners used in beverages etc. That is why the product tastes sweetened.<br /><br />It has 140 calories -- quite a lot for 8 oz of flavored carbonated water -- and all of it is from carbohydrates (36 grams) and over 90% of the carbs (34 grams) are sugars. Apple and grapes have some of the highest concentrations of ""fructose"" a fruit sugar that not only commonly appears in commercial beverages because it is sweeter than regular cane sugar and thus it is cheaper to use, but it is also known to cause diarrhea, particularly in children.<br /><br />So another drink on the hit parade of ""pretend"" healthy drinks- appealing to the masses' concern for their ever-growing girth -- and deluding them that this will help forestall continued growth.<br /><br />You are better off drinking diet coke. You would be even more better off buying the sparkling flavored waters with no calories. My favorite is Bella Familglia -- in pomegranate, lime, lemon and orange flavors -- and is sold from time to time on Amazon as well as your local supermarket.<br /><br />Better yet, buy some organic pure fruit juice -- such as pomegranate and pour  1/8 cup in a glass of your favorite sparking water or a quarter cup in a 16 oz bottle of your favorite sparkling water. At least it is the actual juice and not some fructose extract."
72665,B004X3VRLG,tasteless,"I have a picky dog with tummy troubles who has to eat a prescription diet.  She loves the Newman's treats but they are too hard for her since she is missing half her teeth.  Still, occasionally I hear a crunching sound and she is munching down a Newman's.  I was hoping she would knaw on these treats and thought the center would be a little easier to eat.  Here's how the trial went:<br /><br />Me:  opening the bag ""you want a treat?""<br />Dog:  tail wagging, ears perked up and looking at me intently<br />Me:  I pull one treat from the bag and hand it to her<br />Dog:  She takes it carefully and sets it on the floor. ""sniff, sniff"".  She looks back up at me.  ""sniff"".  She walks away and lays down in her bed.<br />Me:  I pick up the treat and sniff and don't smell anything.  This doesn't mean much since I'm not a dog.  I pull on the outside ""wrapping"".  It's pretty tough.  I push the middle up a little.  It's hard!  I was expecting a softer middle. I taste the middle.  It's tasteless.<br /><br />I tried again to tempt her with one of these treats by giving it to her in place of our nightly ""bite of cheese"" ritual.  Once again she just sniffed of it and then ignored it.  The other treats I've tried with her (beggin strips, puperoni, blue bison apple/yogurt biscuits, milk bone) she will either attempt to eat or carry around in her mouth for several minutes looking for a safe place to hide it.  These treats don't even get the honor of being buried."
19639,B000084ETV,WARNING!!!!,"I used to be a fan of Canidae, but after $2k in recent vet bills and a very sick dog, I found out there is a HUGE amount of Consumer Affairs complaints about this company.<br /><br />After blood work, ultrasound and many other tests trying to figure out why my dog wasn't eating, was throwing up on the rare occasion he did, had pockets of gas the size of base balls (he is a small dog) and had all the symptoms of kidney and liver failure, my vet determined it might be the food. I found that hard to believe, but we couldn't find anything else wrong. If you read the complaints you will see many people have lost their dogs. They started using one of the very companies for production whose imported food killed so many animals a year or so ago.<br /><br />As soon as I quit feeding him this poison, he started getting better. I was one of the lucky ones since my pet did not die, but as I write this, he still has not gained all his weight back.<br /><br />The company is acting as if nothing is wrong. Probably on the advice of their attorneys.<br /><br />You don't need to take my word for it, please read up... http://www.consumeraffairs.com/pets/canidae.html"
62651,B000I1OLT2,ITS ALL NATURAL AND IT TASTE LIKE IT....VERY HEALTHY THOUGH..,"So this is the first green tea ive bought and the second ive tasted. The first one i tasted was alittle better tasting. This stash green tea however does taste lets say, 'natural'. what i mean by that is it taste exactly like what it is, all natural dried herbs. It does look like leafs though not just crushed up almost powdery stuff like the other bag i drank. Im not quite sure what green tea is supposed to taste like but this one is NOT good but its NOT that bad either and its also NOT sweet at all. But hey i am drinking green tea for its health benefits not for its flavor. Overall though i DO recommend this green tea just like the name says it does appear to be premium green tea judging by how it looks and the 'natural' taste, so if your just after those health benefits you wont be disappointed if you want good taste this probably wont make you happy."
4176,B004391DK0,The Best Gluten Free Pancake Mix!!!!!!,"I could not believe how great this mix tasted...it's like eating the regular one.  It came out soooooo good, fluffy and delicious!!!!!"
491557,B001EO773O,bitter,I would not purchase this coffee again. Although drinkable- it needs a lot of creamer to drown out the bitterness.
3140,B000FDKQCY,What a Great Product,"I just got my Bread Machine for Christmas, so being a novice I thought I would try to Keep It Simple :)  The Hodgson Mill Products are wonderful.  Everything is included even the yeast.  The Bread came out delicious, it was easy to slice.  It is like eating a country white bread not soft n mushy like traditional white bread.  My family enjoyed this it makes great toast as well. If you try this I think you will be happy with it"
9221,B006N3IG4K,Works for me.,"This is a good tasting K-cup from a guy who drinks coffee black and prefers a bold, full flavored taste. I would recommend."
22779,B001EO7LQC,Carried at IKEA,"Personally, would cut the added butter or vegetable oil by 1/2 but that is a personal taste.  Would buy again.  As I said, IKEA carries this mix."
3598,B001QEF4XC,Best Dog Food For the Price!,"It's amazing how little popularity that Diamond Pet Foods seems to have considering the quality ingredients their foods contain!  I worked at a pet store for about four years. Our number one recommendations on foods were Natural Balance and Wellness- two EXCEPTIONAL foods that are pretty expensive.  But for those owners who have multiple dogs or even one large breed dog, those brands can cripple your budget.  So when I would get customers who absolutely LOVED their pets and wanted to be able to feed them healthy food without breaking their banks, I recommended Diamond.  Diamond dog food costs about the same as those commercial brands like Purina and Iams, but contains ONLY natural, healthy ingredients.  Just remember, the less garbage you feed your dog (by-products, fillers) the less your dog uses the bathroom- AND they stay fuller, longer!"
4608,B00584HTX4,Great!,I have tried all of the flavors and every one of them are all delicious! They are great for parties and entertaining!
40404,B001ELL3DM,Good for you,"A lot of fiber, pretty tasteless, so I add a lot of fruit to it...and often mix in another cereal.  I like to look forward to my breakfast, and with this I don't unless I do the above.  But, I bought it for the fiber, and for the lack of HFCS, which is what I got.  The pack of six will last a long time, and doubt that I will re-order now that the health food store is starting to carry it, and I can get it one box at a time when I need it."
2470,B002JX7GVM,Best ever!,I have tried all the different brands of coconut water and O.N.E. is my favorite and O.N.E. Coconut Water with a Splash of Pineapple is my favorite flavor. I wish the price would come back down I absolutely love this stuff!
5965,B00063480E,My pups gobble them down!,"Old Mother Hubbard biscuits (we've tried these as well as the puppy variety) are the only true biscuits my dogs like! They would eat the whole bag if I let them. The only thing I don't like is they contain wheat, but as long as your dog doesn't have a wheat allergy, it's no big deal. I would definitely recommend them."
5579,B0040WE938,Not as flavorful as I imagined,"I first came across Lover's Leap Estate tea when buying it from Harney & Sons. I enjoyed that tea very much for its flavorful and clean lightness, reminiscent of an Afternoon Darjeeling. The reason I went with the Elmwood Inn now was that Harney only sells this tea in tins and I wasn't interested in adding a tin to my collection every time I purchased this tea.<br /><br />Of course I cannot be sure that this is exactly the same tea but I must say that the Elmwood Inn fell short of my expectations. It tastes rather uninteresting and almost flat, and in order to get any kind of recognizable flavor, I have to use plenty of leaves. Yet it still never achieves any flavor experience that would justify buying this tea over, lets say, loose Twinings for much less. I will not buy this particular tea again and will continue to search for an equivalent to Harney's Lover's Leap."
7729,B001E5DZTS,The best milk for my baby,We wanted to use milk that was lactose free and close to breast milk.  We began using this milk to supplement my breast milk and we now use it full time.  My baby has never had an allergic reaction to it and he doesn't spit up.  It's gentle on his stomach and Amazon has it at an inexpensive price.  I would suggest this milk to any parent that prefers something different than cow's milk.
69071,B0018KR8V0,Nice snack bar alternative!,"Well, if you are following the ""only eat processed foods with five ingredients or less"" rule, this product, Larabar's ""cherry pie"" fits the bill.  There are three ingredients: dates, almonds, and cherries.<br /><br />As a sports snack, it has 200 calories (70 from fat), 5g protein, and 5g fiber.  It's not a high protein bar for muscle building, but it does have the calories for glycogen replacement.<br /><br />It's not really crumbly or melty, so it transports well.  And if you are looking for a gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, vegan snack, this may be for you.  Most of us will snarf it down in about 4 bites.  If you need something that takes longer to eat, look elsewhere."
29089,B00434J154,I ALMOST LOST IT!,"As soon as I discovered this soup, it started disappearing from local stores. Finally I decided to try Amazon, and now I'm having it automatically delivered by the case once a month for no more than I had been paying locally (at WalMart). This soup has everying I like: a very light cream of tomato base, chicken and a mix of cheese, vegatables and spices that make it the best tasting soup I've found. Try it, you'll like it!"
295874,B000EUINE6,My cat will eat it!,My cat will eat this.  I use it like a pill pocket as my cat will eat this but not the pill pocket.  I think it's cause there's liver in it?
998,B006F2NYI2,this sauce is the shiznit,"this sauce is so good with just about anything, i like adding it to asian food or anything with egg or noodles, it has a good burn with a strong flavor. im hoping to see some of the other flavors like the pineapple experiment on here soon. buy it you wont regret it"
70911,B001I8BOBM,Good deal,"I bought these on sale.  Product arrived promptly and three tubs were wrapped together side by side.  I must admit, the tub looks funny being so small and different from what you see at the grocery store!  The sell date on all three is mid/end of 7/10 so they were not expired, no need to worry."
53559,B0044WY3US,Mix is the non-frozen type,"Oasis sells 2 kinds of mix to make frozen drinks.  I misunderstood the label on Amazon because I thought I was ordering the mix that is always refrigerated.  Oasis ships these with dry ice to maintain the refrigeration. This item is the version that sits on the shelf until opened.  I haven't tasted it yet, but I would have preferred the kind that was likely to have fresher ingredients and less chemicals that must be needed to make this a shelf-stored type of product.  Oh well.... perhaps adding additional rum in the mix will soothe my disappointment."
61490,B000YFE7QY,Awful,Maybe it's just me but I thought this really tasted like crap. Funky aftertaste and just not good tasting in general. Maybe it tastes better when your hungry and freezing while camping up in the mountains but in my kitchen it was no good.
296359,B000VKADSS,My cat eats around the Newman's...but will eat it as last resort ;-),"I consider this a benefit, since my cat is a bottomless pit!<br />It serves to regulate her appetite.<br /><br />If you are in the same ""boat"" then this may work for you as well."
1174,B004XRJ1W4,Gummy Bears,"Well one of my friends asked for a really big bag of gummy bears, she was very pleased when she opened the box. Than her co-worker really like these gummy bears to."
304047,B0029NVJ4M,Kitty Crack,"Just the shaking of the bag and they come running.  I call it ""Kitty Crack""...and I am currently feeding about 19 of them.  One of the ways I can trap to spay/neuter them."
3335,B005K4Q1VI,Best K cup hot cocoa,"This brand is by far the best K cup hot cocoa not that that says much, but it is thicker and less disgusting than the rest."
367678,B003B3OOPA,Good hair mask,I use coconut oil for my hair like a regular hair mask 15 min. before duche.Your hair will feel the differens.Good product.
75919,B001CPOR2E,smokehouse chicken breast strips,"I bought the smokehouse chicken breast strips because they were made in the U.S.A. They are so hard, my dog cannot chew them, and if I break them (which is hard to do), I am afraid she will choke on them. There are not very many ""strips"", mostly pieces.  It is a wasted $22.99, as I will not give them to her. How can you sell something so dangerous."
3550,B000CMFMG8,Pschologically better than peanuts,"Somehow I feel healtier eating these things instead of peanuts. I don't know why either. Also, unlike peanuts, I can limit my intake to a handful and not the whole bag."
499056,B0005YX4B8,Overpriced!,These cost $2.00 from the grocery store!  No reason to buy online if you have access to a grocery store...
56912,B001VNGHMA,Best Dill ever,"This is a great buy for great quality Dill Weed. Why buy little one ounce jars for an outrageous price. ONE POUND of dill weed, packaged in an air tight bag, fresh and full of aroma and taste. Buy a bag and split it up amongst family or friends, or vacuum seal what you're not going to use right away. You won't be disappointed with this product. You may not know what to do with all of it, but you won't be disappointed in the amount, or the quality for the price."
4785,B00139TT72,Newman's Own Organics Dog Food,"I switched my mini-Schauzers over to Newman's Own Organics a month ago when they came off of their puppy chow.  I've been looking for a good quality dog food (rated 4 stars by dogfoodadvisor.com) without going into debt purchasing it!  I was feeding them a different brand that was ""breed-specific"" food, but was having trouble trying to find it in stock anywhere.  A few places, if they carried it at all, only carried the very small bags (2.5 lbs) and with two dogs, one bag would last about 3 - 5 days.  Plus these little 2.5 lb. bags cost more than half what the larger 10 lb. bag  cost!  I tried to make an arrangement to have one of the places order the larger bag for me, but they conveniently ""forgot"" to place the order, so I was stuck purchasing the ridiculously more expensive small bags.  Then I heard about Newman's Own Organics, which is rated a better dog food than the ""breed-specific"" food I was using and cost $$$ less!  And then I discovered that I could buy this food at Amazon.com, have it shipped on a regular basis to my home with no shipping costs and a discount on the food for signing up for the subscription plan delivery - no brainer!!  No more running out of food, no more driving 50 miles or more to find it, no more hassels!<br /><br />And best and most importantly of all, my little guys LOVE IT!!  Their stools firmed up almost immediately after starting the switchover, they seem more active, more alert, more regular and they actually chew this food (they inhaled their puppy chow without chewing!)  I can't say enough good things about both Newman's Own and Amazon's subscription delivery service!"
2394,B0089SPDUW,Delicious,This coffee has a good flavor and a good strength.  At first it seemed strong but then I got use to it.  I recommend this flavor coffee. Good wake up in the morning.
2305,B0002Z9BF8,Great low calorie treat for overweight dogs or for training treats!,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002Z9BF8"">All Natural Dog Treats by Charlee Bear - Cheese & Egg - 16 oz resealable bag</a> These are absolutely great treats for training and for use with overweight dogs. At only 4 calories per treat, even an overweight dog can feel like they are getting treats too, especially in a multi-dog household where one dog is overweight, others are not. Taste must be wonderful since there isn't anything my dogs won't do for these tiny treats, so I'm very pleased with them for many reasons! GREAT PRODUCTS!!!"
7991,B004WM0ZTS,instant coffee,Coffee is good but I don't care for individual pacs. Would rather have coffee in bags like their other coffee is packed.
5818,B00778GG8S,Awesome tasting Tea!,Awesome tasting Tea in a 16 oz. can!  I highly recommend this product because it taste great and doesn't cost a lot.
70159,B007I7Z3Z0,Very refreshing,"If you like ice tea and green tea and don't mind subtle flavors of blackberry & pomegranate & honey, then you will like this product.  It is refreshing and just toned down enough that you can put it in your mountain bike water bottle and do a serious work out to be followed by an enjoyable re-hydration. I will definitely buy this product again."
50144,B0017SWAAW,Terrible!,Not sure what the other reviewers are doing differently than I am but it doesn't taste anything like cheese at all!
39926,B00371V2V0,HORRIBLE!!!!!,"I wish I could give this food ZERO stars! It doesn't even deserve 1 star. I switched from wellness core to this food because I read an OLD review and critique of this food BEFORE P&G bought them. No grain, great limited ingredients, no red flag ingredients, all american product. However, since P&G(heartless, money grubbing, animal testing company that has a track record of ruining every quality pet food brand they buy) bought them they must have changed, at the very least, the quality of ingredients. My cat DOES NOT have a sensitive stomach/GI tract and has never had a reaction to any new food Ive given him. Two days after he started eating this his coat started feeling very coarse and he started having the WORST diarrhea and litterbox odor that filled my entire house. I feed him an entire bag of this stuff and instead of gradually getting better, his problems continually got worse. Towards the bottom of the bag it got to the point that his feces was so liquid, it would drip behind him through two rooms of the house! Gross I know, but I think others need to know how bad his problems were before they think of feeding this food to their babies. He is now on Orijen kibble and a frozen raw diet and the problems stopped the day after I switched him off this food. I believe at one time this was a quality food made by a quality company, but this is not the case anymore. Sad, but I think this food is now along the same lines as crud like meow mix and purina."
20431,B001BDDTB2,8 paws up,"Evidently these are to be sold in the stores as four can packs.  Neat thing, there was a [...]  off your next four packs in side each of the packages.<br /><br />My taste test panel of two - Foutchie and Miss Fuzz gave it 8 paws up.  They eat the expense 85 cent a can fancy stuff, so this compares well to that brand.  Same size.  They list is as Chicken pot pie, and frankly, that is what it looks like--the filing of a pot pie.<br /><br />I always think of Jane Fonda in KLUTE feeding her cat and then licking the spoon of the cat food can herself.  Well, chow down, Jane."
1718,B001RVFDOO,Pop Chips...Yum!!!,"These are the best alternative chips I have ever tried. I have shared them with friends and relatives and they all agree. You get enough in the single serve packs to be truly satisfied and if you are a weight watchers customer, they are GREAT, only 2 points for each bag!!!"
71419,B003YF4CFC,strange tast bought through Amazon,"At age 73, I have eaten gumbo all my life.  This has a strange taste that definitely did harm to the gumbo.  I know there is only one ingrediant, but those sassafras leaves must have been spoiled. There is an unbelieveable amount for the price, but not worth it."
284851,B001P3NU4O,My kitties Adore these Treats!,"My kitties demand these treats every day;  I dare not run out of them, or I'm toast!"
36571,B004CLCEDE,I'd give it zero stars if that was an option.,It's like eating a somewhat chewy rubber band. I couldn't get it to absorb ANY flavor.  I soaked it in various sauces for a couple of days in the fridge and it still had no flavor.
65048,B002C37TM0,Taste better than it sounds!!!,"I was expecting this tea to have somewhat of a bitter taste to it just because of its name.  Boy was I WRONG!!!  This tea can easily be consumed with or without sugar.  I prefer it without sugar, but when I want a sweet taste to it, I'll just add one packet of Sweet & Low.  My energy picks up in about 30 minutes (after drinking the cup of tea) and lasts for approximately 2 hours!!!  You can't beat that at all!!!  Doesn't give me the caffiene jitters that my coffee does.  Now I just substitute one cup of coffee for one cup of Oolong Tea!!!"
6837,B001LG945O,Well it's better than the black cherry anyway,"This is my second can of ""The Switch"" that I'm reviewing under the Amazon Vine program. And while this one is perhaps a bit better it still has the same basic issues -- it's over priced at almost $1 for a mere 8.3oz can in a 24 pack, but more importantly it really just doesn't taste like orange or tangerine at all. The ingredients actually list apple juice as the first type. Now why would you put apple juice in an orange drink? Now don't get me wrong, it tastes exactly like one would expect carbonated juice to taste...but the flavor isn't all that appealing.<br /><br />I love orange juice, drink it every day. I'd love to try carbonated orange juice...but this is far from that. It MIGHT be a good substitute for normal soda for kids, but I can't imagine any other real reason to get this."
5577,B005WINEYO,Delicious,"The smell alone will make you salivate, it is that good. It comes with rock sugar mixed in, so I don't ever use any added sweeteners."
158386,B000HDMVNY,Great stuff!,I've been using this product for years - you could say I'm addicted to it! Local stores used to carry it but no more so I'm thrilled Amazon has it. Now if we could just get the 3lb size I'd be in heaven!
50251,B000FBQ50I,These cookies are $2.19 in my SuperMarket,We were buying Bahlsen cookies at $1.70-$2.19 at lockal supermarket until I found that they are $1.41/box here at Amazon!
95696,B003FXIUWY,Don't buy the Sobe Mango Mandrian coconut flavor,Save yourself the money do NOT buy the Sobe Lifewater  Mango mandrian w/ coconut flavor- GAG.<br />Not that I know what a smelly arm pit tastes like but it would have to be very similar to this distgusting Sobe flavor.
295022,B0001VWG50,Just what my food needed!!!!,"I am so happy I found this product!!! In Latin america it's called achiote, it's really difficult to find in powder form in the US. This is just what my food needed!!! Wooohooo!!!!"
21174,B002QWP89S,Teenie Greenies,These are the only treats I can get my dog to eat. She has to be limited as she will make a meal on these if I would let her.
34085,B000LKVDUU,Good for times u don't wanna cook.,I like the product coz of its convinience & as it comes from agood brand I don't feel guilty using packaged food for my family.
4865,B002FVQX3A,"Yummy, but it does not last","Tastes very good.  I really like the taste.<br /><br />But then it is gone.  Like it was never there.  So fleeting.<br /><br />Takes two pieces to really enjoy, also.<br /><br />And be VERY careful not to eat it.  Seriously, it is hard not to swallow it.  Laugh all you want.  You try it and see what I mean."
18447,B001M051UQ,PASKESZ APPLE CHIPS,"I WAS SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED WITH THESE APPLE CHIPS.  I HAVE PURCHASED SENECA APPLE CHIPS IN THE PAST--I REALLY LOVED THEM. I THOUGHT THESE WOULD BE SIMILAR, BUT THEY ARE RATHER TASTELESS, THE CHIPS ARE TOO BIG, & THEY HAVE A MUSHY CONSISTENCY.  I WOULD NOT BUY THEM AGAIN."
391767,B000ODV07K,Freshen Up gum,Product arrived in timely manner.<br />Product is bubble gum flavored that has a juicy center.<br />Fun and tasty gum.
406,B000C21OOM,Sweet and Soothing,"This is a wonderful warm flavored tea, especially now in colder weather.<br />This tea has a sweet,soothing chamomile fragrance. It is subtle and sweet.It's one of the better chamomile teas.<br />If you find it hard to sleep at times, a cup of this sweet chamomile tea may help.<br />If you really like sweet taste try Bigelow Chamomile Mango Herbal Tea.<br />I highly recommend both."

10168,B003EML8PM,Hard To Cook,"I don't know if I got a bad batch or something, but I could'nt get these to cook right. I followed the instructions and after about two minutes, the bag stoped expanding. I opened it and found everything badly burnt. the next bag I waited about one and a half minutes. I opened it and found half the chips uncooked. I never could find a time that either left some uncooked or some burnt. (I shook the bags and scattered the chips inside them well before microwaving each time)"

34638,B0018CJJ9C,Finally found a kibble my allergic dog can eat.,"My terrier has many food allergies (beef, fish, dairy, corn, soy, chicken are among those we KNOW).  I had been making her food from scratch using venison, brown rice and peas.  We tried several kibbles including anti allergy perscription types(venison can get very hard to find / expensive out of hunting season) and all of them caused reactions.  This is a little expensive, but it's SO much cheaper and easier than making her food from scratch.  She LOVES the taste (picks it out of the venison meat when mixed together) and all of my dogs now get this kibble as treats so we have less chance of her getting something she is allergic to by accident.  I am so very thankful to have found this food."
253740,B000GHJJVI,atlaca,I received the product in a timely manner and in execellent condition.  I would order from this vendor again.
56432,B000EHL21U,EXPIRATION DATES SUCK FOR THIS,"I bought these bars to use in my ""hurricane food stash"". They taste good, are somewhat chewy- watch your expensive fillings. Complaint: the expiration date is 7 months away!!!! Boo Hiss. I hope the seller isnt getting these bars cheap because they are close to expiring and then passing them on to us on Amazon. I checked my daughter-in-laws Kashi bars that she bought at local grocery-they expire October 2011...grrr...me not happy."
65250,B00063KNX0,Beware of this product--one of our dogs died.,"You should monitor your dog very carefully if you give him/her these chews. One of our dogs died as a result of eating these chews, and the other three were very ill for two days. This product is very difficult for dogs to digest and can result in blocked intestines and infection. Since the package did not contain any warnings, we thought they were harmless. Be very careful if you buy these for your dog."
7308,B0029XO8OA,Flavorful and Natural Garrotxa Goat Cheese,"I love cheese in general. I've had lots of European cheeses, and this one is OUTSTANDING.<br /><br />The texture is a bit hard, not creamy as French cheeses; and the flavor is full and rich. Great to serve with some bread and of course, some wine. It is great with salads as well, you won't need any dressing since the cheese is enough a good flavor enhancer by itself.<br /><br />I have shared it with many guests and they ALL love it. It's not salty like Cheddar and smoked cheeses, it's more of a refined goat-milky flavor.<br /><br />It's always a Success!"
237900,B004P6ITRQ,That Company SUCKS and Hard to Deal With,"It took forever to get my cookies, and I paid for express shipping and got my product 3 weeks later, I will never order from that company again."
188797,B000HDONP8,cookies,I did not care for the ingredients. I have food intolerance and something did not sit well. I gave them away.
2619,B0016FY6H6,Stash Instant Green Tea,"I make a ""jug"" of this tea every morning and keep a glass throughout the day.  I'm delighted to find a source in the US as it was introduced to me in B.C.  It does not have the jasmine flavor which upsets my otherwise very strong tummy."
72708,B001TZMCD8,Lucky Find,Just what I was looking for.  Pomegranate Molasses is very hard to find in the stores but I went right to it when I checked the Internet.
154569,B002AQ0OL2,Defective K Cups,"We have been subscribers to K Cups from Amazon but the last two orders are defective, leak, and fill you cup with grounds.  Not a value in my estimation!  How about some quality control????"
4909,B0009JMW1C,Sinus Help,"I found this tea by accident but it worked so well that i later ordered it,<br /><br />after not being able to find it again.  It really helps open nasal passages.<br /><br />Since starting to use it whenever I have bad nasal congestion, I have not<br /><br />had a sinus infection.  Everyone is different, but it sure worked for me."
5323,B000BYLQW6,My dogs love them,My dogs (and some other dogs I like to spoil too) just love these.  They are their special treats.
36620,B004CLCEDE,Miracle Noodles - its a miracle you can even get past the smell!!!,There was no miracle about these noodles! They are in fact the worst thing I have ever attempted to eat in my life. They were so horrible I don't even care about returning them! For some laughs I gave them to friends to gag over just as I did!
21014,B002QWP89S,Great for picky eaters,My dog is the pickiest eater and does not enjoy many treats but he goes crazy over this one. It helps freshen his breath but I don't know how to evaluate the cleaning ability of this product. The only bad thing is that it will make your dog fat if he eats too much.
7162,B004K30HO2,LOVE IT!!!!!,i had a kerig before and it broke. the company said it was because i was using expresso in the k-cup and it was to fine and cloged the machine. kerig does not make a k-cup with spanish coffee so when i found these i was very happy. i have been using these for about a month and i love them and it is so much cheaper. i would highly recommend these.
30438,B000X95SYQ,"Oh, poo!","Our cats ran to their bowls to try their first bits of Avoderm dry food, properly mixed in with their regular fancy kibble. Being Maine Coons with crafty little paws and ambitious little brains, they managed to pick out the Avoderm bits and eat those first.<br /><br />Yum, a hit! It smells meaty and clearly appeals to them.<br /><br />But we won't be buying Avoderm again....the poo is horrific. Wet, runny, stinky beyond belief. My big boy, who did mind his manners and ate a graduated amount of the mix over a week as the bag described, had the worst reaction of all. Poor guy cried as he pooped, had diarrhea everywhere, and calmly climbed into the laundry sink for washing as if he understood he was a stinky boy.<br /><br />So yes, it is tasty and priced well, but the aftermath is not worth it. 12 paws and two thumbs down."
2018,B001E5E29A,Delicious waffles in minutes!,"Makes perfect, delicious, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, waffles in minutes. Worth every penny!"
8308,B003VXFK44,Milder than expected,"Never had Hawaiian Hazelnut before so I didn't know what to expect, but it turns out it's pretty good, not as flavored as say DD, but nonetheless pretty good. I have it on subscription now along with the German Chocolate Cake, another one of my favorite flavored K-cups."
22782,B002ARE9TY,Nuts had gone bad.,"Maybe I got the runt of the litter, but when I opened the bag, the foul musty/moldy smell hit me in the face. Even though the label (which was just a printed sticker as opposed to something stamped on the bag itself) said good until 1/2013, there was no doubt that the food had gone bad. Very disappointing."
21178,B002QWP89S,Great Product,"My pug loves his ""Toothbrushes.""  THey help keep away dog breath, and I don't see a lot of plaque build up on his teeth."
4536,B002TMV3E4,no complaints,"We don't drink much coffee, and less decaf, but we have guests who do and so we like to keep some ground decaf in the freezer for when they visit. Everybody has been pleased with the Melitta. Nobody has complained about the taste, and plenty of folks have asked for second cups so they weren't just being politely quiet. We got the first sample free through the Vine program but I would buy it in the future."
60754,B003QNJYXM,"product great, Company outstanding",The company was on time and as advertised. We have used the product for some time and it works without giving you the jitters or the sudden collapse you get with caffiene products.

7485,B000143ZK2,my favorite prize for students,"Grandpa Po's Originals are my students' favorite prize for the classroom. Our school district has banned junk food for incentives for kids so Grandpa Po's is a perfect fit. The kids get a bag when they complete all of their assignments for the month. They love the snack and they work hard to get all their work done. Their parents love the reward too and many students come back to buy more to take home to the family. Thanks, Grandpa Po for your ""better than food"" snack!"
332170,B000YDIXDO,My Dog Loves These,My miniature Labradoodle just loves these.  I give her 1/2 at a time because she can rip through these like nobody's business.  I keep them around as a change of pace from the Nylabone Flexi-chews.
6667,B001LG945O,Great taste - not overly sweet,This is a very refreshing carbonated juice drink with no aftertaste.  I love the flavor and the fact that there is no added sugar.  It's more subtle than orange so really kills a thirst.  The size is perfect for times when you don't really want a 12 ounce drink.
3228,B005K4Q1VI,Great taste,"I have purchased other hot cocoa cups but find Grove Square to be about the best of them all.  I usually add two teaspoons of the the flavored coffeemate creamers, my favorite being the Sugar Free Caramel Macchiato.  By adding the sugar free creamer the taste is there but not the calories."
14210,B0045XE32E,My dog REALLY likes these,"When I give her one of these treats, my dog snatches it, runs off, greedily wolfs it down, then spends 5 minutes going back over the place where she ate it, trying to hoover up the crumbs.  I don't think you can ask for much more than that from a dog treat.  They are pretty hard and a pretty good size, so the dog seems to have a little trouble getting it broken down (she's a relatively small beagle).  Really small dogs might need these broken up a bit.  I don't think it's a problem that they take a while for the dog to consume, since that means she eats it a bit slower and it's longer before she comes back to me begging for some more."
50434,B000UH3QWW,Candy sticks were broken,Purchased the 80 count tutti frutti candy sticks for my wedding buffet..at least 60 were broken. Not happy and will have to purchase from somewhere else. Wasted my money & just going to throw these away..

59538,B001A7RNB6,Caterpillar control,I found this product very difficult to use.  Don't think I would purchase it again.  The powder would not come out of the container easily.  Would not recommend it.
2222,B002C4HZ00,False advertising!,"Buyer beware! The label on the Amazon site clearly states ""D.O.P Certified"" but the product received does NOT match the site label and does NOT state ""D.O.P. Certified"" This is bait and switch and I will file a complaint with Amazon."
157310,B0019QT66I,Calm it works!,"I have used this before, it keeps me from getting leg cramps. I have used it for several years. I find that when I am dieting I tend to get leg cramps at night, taking this nightly completly stops them."
61716,B001E5DRWI,The worst,"These are not only black sesame seeds.<br />Some other kinds of seeds (fennel?) are also in here.  This is a supreme disappointment, as when I purchase ""black sesame seeds,"" I expect black sesame seeds.<br />These don't even smell like black sesame seeds.<br /><br />The kind from JFC is much better."
4575,B002TMV3E4,A decent cuppa,"I'm not a coffee snob.  I can tell that there is a difference between Kenyan and Columbian, but I can't tell you which is which without a label.  This decaf tastes good.  I like mine with lots of fake sugar and cream; the coffee flavor isn't subdued by these additions.  The bag ultimately required scissors to open.  The blurb for this says ""(pack of 3)""; I only got one bag.  Not sure why that is; it's happened before with other products.  Would I buy this again?  Sure, if it was on sale . . . that's how I buy my coffee most of the time."
7519,B000OIWY8Y,ADDICTIVELY FANTASTIC!!,"Lana's Snowflake Black Tea with Coconut and Almond has now become my favorite tea. First the smoothness is unbeatable. I found it a bit smoother than the Hanley Vanilla cormoro! Secondly,the aroma changes from the time you smell it in the bag and then brew, it is a great experience. When you taste it you have a wonderful surprise of sweetness and comfort. Sort of a nutty, caramel with vanilla notes, it is the PERFECT Dessert tea. My husband lost 18 lbs by drinking this instead of having ice cream! Now when you present it to friends,let them taste it first. If they go by the  intense aroma in the bag, it is so fresh some  have wrongly thought it was too strong a flavor, but it is not. It is the amazing  freshness they are not used to.  We served this at our wedding vow renewal and it beat out hanleys vanilla cormoro and Paris too.  This tea has filled a gap I have had in my collection, I have searched for a flavor like this over 3 years!!<br />Lana Please keep on creating this tea, I am definitely coming back for more.<br />And thank you for tremendous and fast service... btw, i am sipping this as i write.. YUM!<br />smiles, grace in VT"
20,B001GVISJM,Home delivered twizlers,Candy was delivered very fast and was purchased at a reasonable price.  I was home bound and unable to get to a store so this was perfect for me.
86712,B001J4GHOO,Excellent product!,"It was recommended by a dentist on a ""Doctors"" show. I could not find it in a drug stores. Thank you Amazon!!!!"
32731,B0083QJU72,worst first expierence,This product completely dissapointed me. Im doing the lemonade diet and i was looking so foward to this maple syrup sweeting my lemonade but boy was i wrong. as soon as i tried it tasted horrible. you get such a nasty after taste. i would never buy this again
56233,B0039ZOZ86,Salted Styrofoam - But Low-Cal!,"Gourmet Basics indeed! I think the basics are to keep it simple and let the natural flavor of the food shine through. I am blown away that they have actually managed to make a ""natural food"" taste faker than <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00346J90Y"">Andy Capp Hot Fries, 3-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>. Rice cakes have a luxurious mouth-feel compared to these. I couldn't get past the fake flavor and horrible texture.<br /><br />I just can't imagine what type of odd palate people must have to think that these abominations are tasty. Perhaps people who are on a restricted diet might find these a convenient snack food. Or parents tricking their kids into eating healthy. I can almost promise the parents that these snacks will go uneaten. I would have been more likely to eat the unsweetened Baker's Chocolate in the pantry before I'd eat these.<br /><br />Though this product might be suggested by Amazon if you purchase Popcorners or Popchips, do not buy it. These are nothing like Popcorners or Popchips, these ""Smart Fries"" are nothing but awful."
22615,B002CJAOTY,price jumps be warned,I purchased this item on subscription for less than $10 and<br />was rudely shocked this month went it went up to<br />$16. I'm cancelling. This is ridiculous. Cheaper in the store.
913,B000ER6YO0,good for you but not best flavor,"We love earth's best organic baby food, but this is not the tastiest one. I've tried it myself and think it is pretty gross. But my daughter still eats it, just not with as much enthusiasm as other flavors. It's got a decent amount of protein, which is important for us as a vegetarian family."
3924,B000F9BCQ2,Zesty spearmint and lemon are modulated by green tea into a substantial potion!,"Zen brews up to an golden amber liquor. The aroma is sweet spearmint. The blending of this tea is excellent--spearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it. Slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor, then you taste a hint of lemon. The green tea provides an herbal base for these two flavors that makes the intial impression of zesty spearmint and lemon modulate into a substantial potion. Very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertaste.<br /><br />Remember that this tea does have caffeine--however, it does not say how much on the box. A good estimate might be 30 mg--compared to 90mg for the average cup of coffee. Make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter. Four minutes is ample."
4944,B000FYYOZI,Honey Beef sticks in saddlebag packaging,"I like this product very much. The Honey flavor makes them taste very good and they are bigger and thicker than most others I've seen. The saddlebag package is ingenious. why open and expose to the air all 100 when you only have to open half at a time. leave one half (50) completely sealed. One package of 100 thick beef sticks can sustain someone for a very long time. Use for emergency shelters,mountain climbing ,backpacking, camping, hiking, survival training, or any survival situation.theres plenty (100), so you could sustain yourself a long time if lost.Just these very light storable beefsticks and a jar of peanut butter unopened and a large jug of water in a vehicle could sustain life for a very long time at a minimum of space and weight.They appear kind of home made, unlike any beef sticks I have seen in stores before. My dogs like them also.I break off 1/2""pieces whenever they need a treat. I see nothing in the ingredients that suggest dogs can't eat them.However I want each person to evaluate this on their own not just because I say so. My 5 dogs have had pieces of them now and then and love them and havent shown any signs of being sick or having less energy. I recommend them."
78872,B000HK9IKG,It's hard to strike a balance with this flavor,"I've read a lot recently on how bad artificial sweeteners are for our health, so I decided to give this chocolate flavored liquid stevia a try.<br /><br />I simply cannot drink my coffee black, I was adding Hershey's sugar-free chocolate syrup and skim milk to my morning coffee. This stevia is a good substitute, but it's a flavor/sweetener I will have to learn to love. So far, not loving it, but it's better for me so I will buck up and maybe change my star rating later.<br /><br />I am experimenting at the moment, starting out with 5 drops per 8 ounces of coffee, it's sweet enough, but not enough chocolate flavor. Upping it to 8 drops per cup, it's starting to get there with the chocolate flavor, but it's too sweet.<br /><br />The Sweetleaf is all natural, has no calories, and is also rated 0 (zero) on the glycemic index.<br /><br />Also, you may think the price of this is expensive initially, but one 2 ounce bottle has around 300 servings, so it's cheaper for me considering the price of the Hershey's sugar-free syrup."
50655,B001EO7O9G,"Small, dry portions","Two things disappointed me about this product. First, the portions really are tiny -- two ounces makes a thin piece about two inches by two inches square, and that includes skin. It's enough for a small appetizer for one, but no more. I would not give someone such a skimpy amount as a gift.<br /><br />Second, the salmon itself is on the dry side. While I don't like my smoked salmon to be *too* oily, this goes to the opposite extreme. The result is not as flavorful and satisfying as I would prefer.<br /><br />I will definitely eat the remaining packs, but would not buy this product again."
119319,B003Z7VYXW,Good but...,It has been no problem to use it but there are not any date of production or expire.<br />Amazon sent me them again but still no date.<br />I can not understand. I just gave up...
67326,B004JRXZKM,Pasta!,"These noodles taste just like pasta but without the calories, fat, carbs, etc because there are 0 in all counts! You just open the package, rinse them, blanch them for one minute, drain and then put them on a paper towel to soak up some of the water. I've only used them for spaghetti but can't wait to try them with something else."

432690,B003MWBFXY,Meow!,What can I say...this is the only brand of food my cat will eat. She tears into the bag by chewing on it as soon as I get it. I have to pour in into a plastic container. It also controls hair balls.
201272,B000GW46DE,If you like SALT,"I thought this was the beef jerky that I was used to getting from the gas station on my trips. However, after eating one stick(really two sticks in one).

5712,B002ANCCK6,"Great, high-quality cat food","I've tried a number of high-quality canned cat foods to supplement the dry food my cats always have available to them, and these appear to be the best as judged by me and the cats.  For one thing, these actually look like fish.  You open the can, and there are large pieces of actual fish in the can, instead of the weird, mystery paste.  It pretty much smells like you've opened a can of real fish, too (not in a bad way, though I don't share my cats' love of sardines.)<br /><br />One of my two cats is a picky eater when it comes to canned food.  I picked up a can of each of the varieties from the local pet store when I wanted to try switching to Tiki Cat, and learned that the picky one will only eat the varieties that include sardines.  There are a few different sardine varieties, so at least it forces her to have some variety in her diet in case they stop producing one of them.<br /><br />The picky one has always been very excited about getting her daily quota of canned food, but the other cat seems way more excited about dinner time since we switched to Tiki Cat, so I take that as her endorsement of this positive review."
64486,B001BM4NWM,Major Dents in Cans,"I love this soup for my children, but I'm not sure about ordering it online anymore.  8 of the 12 cans had major dents.  I mean 2 to 3 INCH dents that were 1/4 inch deep.  This is unacceptable quality.  Since the price has gone up drastically since I started ordering online a few years ago, I will now go to the store and pay the same price for undented cans."

2108,B000EPP56U,Crisp and delicious / extreme price hike,"First time buyer of KA-ME Rice Crackers and I'm very impressed. These are very light, crisp and flavorful. They are as good plain as they are with cold cuts, fruit, etc. Unfortunately, the ones I purchased may be the last I get from this source. Right after I purchased the dozen packs, the price per dozen increased 44% to its present $37.99. Fortunately, I have enough to last a while, but assuming the price stays the same, these are my last KA-ME."
28394,B007OXJMD2,Fair,I selected this product as I do not tolerate the caffeine of full bodied coffee. However I was disappointed with this product. It tastes like flavored water - no real coffee  taste. I have used a stronger setting on the Keirig which helps a bit. It is tasty however with a hot chocolate blend.
9064,B006N3IG4K,Best so far,"I'm a relative newcomer to Keurig coffee, but I do know that I was generally disappointed in the drink produced. However, the Breakfast in Bed K-Cup produces a nicely balanced, not-too-thin cup without being too harsh. I still haven't achieved anything like what I can make either with my french press or with my drip machine, but it's definitely better than the at-work alternative, Community Coffee."
12813,B002J9HQJS,Doggy Dent a winner,"My dog is a very fussy eater.  Getting her to eat everyday is a challenge.  But she loves these mini sized ""greenies"".  As soon as she hears me open the bag, she is patiently waiting for her treat."
80276,B004342XH2,"Yuck, and needs better advitising for the sucrolose ingredient","I got a bunch of these from a friend and wondered about the bad after taste. It wasn't like products completely flavored with Splenda (sucrolose) but it still a slight strange taste (I describe it as slimy) and left that after taste in my mouth. On the k-cup it self, it doesn't say it has artificial sweeteners or is diet, so I came to the internet and it is almost impossible to find the ingredients listed any where. The reviews were the confirmation at first. Too much Splenda makes me sick to my stomach so I know it is not good for me. Too much is more than a few tastes. Oh well, I guess I'll try the Grove Square or Swiss Mix as those are the only others I can find.<br /><br />I find the taste of this product unappealing and the after taste sickening."

55784,B004P8JMXO,"Messy, sharp!","I was hoping these bones would be a little harder for my dogs to comsume.  I bought them  for Christmas and thought the dogs could knaw on them for an hour or so while we were opening presents, but the bones are quite brittle and only took them about 10 minutes to consume.  Also, the shards are quite sharp and I got a little worried.  They were insanely messy for in the house.  I think for the money I would rather buy either those hard, filled bones or the rolled up raw hides.  They last longer, are less messy, and don't have sharp pieces for the dogs to swallow."
2838,B0085G4ACA,Best Flavor- Light but Refreshing,"I tried quite a few varieties of this brand and the pineapple is the best.  Light but refreshing.  I am not sure if I think it is a miracle elixer or anything but I did purchase a case and look forward to drinking this on a regular basis.  Thank you for the great value and convenience, Amazon."

6000,B003SE52K8,pleased with this recommendation,We tried all flavors for our cats and the rabbit was the apparent favorite for all of them. Took a recommendation from catinfo.org for this food as it is closest to the diet that a cat would naturally eat. Coats are softer and glossy. Energy levels seem to be up. Quite pleased with the results so far.
13707,B00513J4D0,Fussie Cat canned cat food,"My cat, Mango, just loves this cat food.  It is the only brand of food that he will eat on a daily basis.

After a bad few months I did some research and found this bisquick. I have only made one thing so far, garlic cheese biscuits. They were very tasty and had no strange texture or flavor. They had a more spongey texture than a crumbly biscuits but I was halving the recipe so maybe that was why. I nibbled on a biscuit hours out of the oven and it was still as soft and tasty. I can't wait to try pancakes and coffee cake. The only draw back is how small the box is for the price! I will limit the use to once a week or so for a treat!"
6240,B000E1HVW0,Shake N Bake Barbeque Chicken is the absolute BEST!!!!,We live in Tucson AZ and all of a sudden we can't find this one product anywhere in Tucson.

16052,B001IVVUTU,Worst root beer ever.,"My kids and I love root beer and I brew my own from time to time. Recently while purchasing some specialty versions from a local store I saw the Jack Blacks Red Dead Root Beer and thought the label was cool so I grabbed a couple. After we sampled it, all I can say is don't waste your time. It has little to no root beer flavor,it finishes a little spicy in fact. It has caffine added which was a bit of a put off as well. I was very disappointed with the flavor of this product. If you want a pick me up and you don't mind it tasting like sugar water mixed with dish soap then this is the drink for you."
493677,B000H27LBC,What a Bust,"I have ordered this product twice. The product tastes fine. The problem is with breakage.<br /><br />The first time I ordered this product from Amazon more than 1/2 of the Bagel Snacks in all the boxes where broken into various size pieces. Since I had bought this product at the store before buying it a Amazon, and never had the contents broken into pieces like what I got from Amazon, I thought I would try to order it from Amazon again. Same result. At least half of the Bagel Snacks in all the boxes were broken into various size pieces from from dust size to larger pieces.<br /><br />Back to the store for more."
77989,B000VK8HCW,My picky eaters love it!,"I have two Yorkies that are very picky eaters.  After a period of 2-3 days up to 2-3 weeks they will decide they don't like the food I am giving them and just stop eating.  I went through a real struggle when one of them got a stomach bug and got real sick with vomiting and diarrhea.  I started cooking fresh turkey with brown rice and his stomach healed up in no time.  But them I couldn't get them back onto dog food!!  I found the Newman's Organic Turkey and Brown Rice formula and they LOVE it.  I still give them a good quality dry food for little snack times.  However, they usually wait for their turkey and rice and gobble it up.  They have lots of energy and for the last two months have not gotten tired of the food.  I think we have found a keeper!"
4109,B001EW5YQS,Icicle on Mac OS X,"This Icicle performs flawlessly with very good audio quality for my audio-technica cardiod condensor mic.  Took me a short while to figure out the little silver button on the side wasn't a button, but instead a rotational knob for setting the gain.  This device literally plugs into your USB port on a Mac, you adjust that knob, and your done.  You then can forget about the device and enjoy flawless audio performance out of your mic.  This beats the hell out of the more expensive FireWire solutions I had used before."
36636,B004CLCEDE,0 calories-awesome!,"I was prepared for an awful smell when opening the bag based on the reviews. The water smells like fish, not a big deal to me. I rinsed the noodles for 2 minutes in hot water, then placed in boiling water for another 2-3 minutes. I then mixed the noodles with the sauce only from a popular Spicy Szechuan Style Vegetable & Chicken weight loss frozen food (softened it in the microwave, then cut the sauce from the noodles packaged with it). I put the noodles with the sauce in the fridge for 22 hours before eating them based on the suggestion of other reviews.<br /><br />The texture is.....strange. There is no food product on the market that I can 100% compare it to. They are rubbery and somewhat hard to break down with your teeth when you chew them.<br /><br />Marinating the noodles did not help, they were still flavorless, but it didn't matter very much because the sauce itself was spicy enough to mask the fact that the noodles had no flavor.<br /><br />I'd suggest the noodles to anyone trying to lose weight or cut down on carbs. They are not something I would want to eat otherwise."
4958,B002RZ1QNG,"not bad, I like the tropical riesling better","I bought this kit after I really enjoyed making the tropical riesling from the same manufacturer.  It was equally easy to make, but it is very peary.  I wouldn't have minded it if it was more subtle.  Still very drinkable, but I suspect that I'll be mixing it more."
25091,B0081XIA1E,Entertaining,"We bought this toy for our two granddogs as a Christmas present.<br />The larger, a boxer/pit bull mix was clever enough to grab onto the<br />yellow cups & just lift & easily found the treats. However, the<br />beagle was unable to grab onto the cups thus making him work harder<br />for the treats. Its quite entertaining to watch him go crazy trying<br />to figure it out. It keeps him occupied for about ten minutes."
16421,B007TJGZ54,Something's wrong with this coffee,These K-cups are either extremely old or they're not authentic Green Mountain K-cups. The coffee is weak and has a bad after-taste. Both my spouse and I have noticed this independently of each other.<br /><br />I tried to contact the seller to ask about this but couldn't figure out who it was.
431554,B0007OPW3O,Yum,Takes me back to my childhood.  I always stopped at the People's Drug Store and got a pack of Chuckles on my way to school.  Now I can LOAD UP.
2821,B0085G4ACA,Great coconut water in just the right size!,"This has been my favorite brand of coconut water of the ones I've tried. They use real fruit juice for flavoring, as well as it tastes good.<br /><br />We tried the smaller size, and they just aren't large enough to get enough water at the gym, and are not resealable.<br /><br />Things I like about this:<br /><br />* Perfect size for an hour long gym routine<br />* Resealable cap(smaller one lacks this)<br />* Tasty (Like a pina colada)<br /><br />Negative<br /><br />* Box makes it hard to get the last drops- usually end up squishing it up to get the last bit<br /><br />So great coconut water, perfect size, and cheaper than buying locally at sprouts with the Amazon's 'subscribe and save'!"
1214,B005O072PC,Very Good,"Very good side dish, easy to make, easy to eat.  As others have said, needs a little spice, but other than that they are delicious!"
3785,B00016UX0K,Too much,These are very large bottles. It is a good dipping sauce with a sweet/spicy flavor.
218329,B007RV5I2K,nuggets sours,the sours came all stuck together so that you had to peel away the wrapper and literally eat them all in one chunk. would not buy again
59738,B001SER0L4,Awesome formula!,"This is the only formula we used once I stopped nursing my son when he was 8 months old. It is a bit expensive, but it's worth it if you're concerned about having organic formula. My son had no problem switching from breast milk to this formula."
26871,B000FPGZ3Q,21 month old loves this,My son has recently gotten very picky at what he wants to eat. A few months ago he hated the texture of mash potatoes but he loves this.
2727,B003NDA970,Very good popocorn,"My doctor told me I must eat ""hulless"" popcorn if I have popcorn at all.  Because I can't give up my favorite snack, I bought this Wabash Famnily Farms Amish Country popcorn.  The kernels are tiny, but they pop well, although not as big and fluffy as the popcorn I get from the grocery store.  It tastes great, however, and has fewer and smaller hulls.  I don't think there is such a thing as completely hulless,but Ido notice thst I don't get the hulls stuck in my teeth anymore."
44098,B005R625PK,Not for me,One thing that me and my wife can agree on is that we do not like this coffee. We have tried several brands of kona and other Hawaiian coffee beans with this one being very low on the pole. We mixed these beans with another brand as felt the need to use them because of the price paid. Have about 1/4 pound left and will glad when they are gone. I really do not like to leave bad a bad review!
68573,B0026LIO9A,Works for multi-cat families (Chicken Flavor),"If you have a multi-cat family and are struggling to find common ground to minimize digestion disturbances amongst all of them, this is a good bet.  My cats don't *love* this food, but they all tolerate it well and don't run away from it immediately after I pour it.<br /><br />Amazon's prices are unbeatable too, even for the small (2lb bags).  While it seems weird to get so many small bags, my cats appreciate it because the these bags don't reseal well, so with smaller bags, the food is fresher in general.<br /><br />As mentioned in the subject, this only applies to the Chicken flavor, my cats don't care for the others."
1826,B001RVFDOO,Popchips vs Baked Lays? Baked Lays taste MUCH better.,"I love Amazon and I love the reviews from people, I've been introduced to alot of great products b/c of the reviews, but this time? Total, complete LET DOWN! Popchips having 4.5 stars is just down right perplexing!?! The should not get more than a 3, but generally 1-2. I sorta want to give it a 1, but the packaging is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing so I through in the extra point.<br /><br />I ordered these thinking that'd they'd be maybe a slightly better version of Baked Lays. Man was I wrong... I've tried most of the Baked Lays flavors, my go-to's at first were 1.) original baked lays and 2.) sour cream baked lays (since those are my favorite regular lays). But then  I discovered BBQ Baked Lays. And seriously, those are FANTASTICALLY great. BBQ Baked Lays are packed with SO much flavor.<br /><br />These Popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips. Literally they do. Because they aren't as good as Baked Lays I can definitely see eating much less of them (which could be a benefit), but I say just use portion control-- and zip lock bag a bunch of Baked Lays.<br /><br />I'm trying to think of ways to go into more detail, but there's really not much more I can say.<br /><br />****SUMMARY****<br /><br />How do Popchips taste? Like slightly burnt air chips. (it's sort of a weird taste, takes ALOT of getting used to)<br /><br />Would I suggest buying them? No. If you're eager to try them, I say buy a bag from your local grocery store. A week or so after I ordered these on here I saw them at m local Krogers, so they're definitely expanding.<br /><br />Nutrition Information: 1 bag (.8 oz/ 23g) = 100 calories, Total Fat = 3g (5%), Sodium = 210 mg (9%), Total Carbohydrate = 16g (5%), Dietary Fiber = 1 g (4%), Sugar = 2g, Protein 1 g, Vitamin A , Vitamin C, Calcium, and Iron = 2 %.<br /><br />If you buy a big bag of BBQ Popchips and big bag of BBQ Baked Lays, here are the nutrition information side-by-side:<br /><br />**POP CHIPS:**<br />Serving Size: 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories= 120, Total Fat = 4.5g (6%), Sodium 280mg (11%), Total Carbohydrate 20g (6%),<br />Dietary Fiber 1g (4%), Sugars 2g, Protein 1g<br /><br />**BAKED LAYS:**<br />Serving Size= 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories = 120, Total Fat 3g (5%),  Sodium 210mg (9%), Potassium 230mg, Total Carbohydrate 22g (7%), Dietary Fiber 2g 8%, Sugars 3g, Protein 2g, Vitamin C 4%, Calcium 2%<br /><br />So these two are very close, but Baked Lays wins because it virtually has not sodium, since potassium 230mg offsets the Sodium 210mg, leaving 20g of Potassium. Plus there's more Fiber and more Vitamin C. And most importantly they taste better.<br /><br />I for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that Baked Lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit.<br /><br />At the end of the day make a decision for yourself, but I'd strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first. Maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both Baked Lays and Popchips... I can almost guarantee you that Baked Lays will win hands down.<br /><br />(Hopefully Amazon starts selling well-priced variety single-serve bags of Baked Lays soon. For now I found one from a seller, but the price seems a little high (but there are 40 bags instead of 20): <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TVDHIO"">Smart Mix Variety Pack, 30-Count: 7-Baked Lay's Classic, 6-Baked Cheetos, 6-Baked Ruffles, 6-Baked Doritos Nachos Cheese & 5-Rold Gold Tiny Twists (Pack of 2)</a> )"
2678,B0016FY6H6,Don't bother,"I bought this ""flavor"" and the raspberry pom and while they are consistent, it's useless.<br /><br />If you plan on making a pitcher of tea, forget it, it takes 4 packs for 64 oz and is still very, very weak in flavor, and it must be consumed in 12 hours (so they say) so you're much better off brewing your own.<br /><br />However, if you're idea is to ""stash"" this in your purse (for the ladies) or pocket (for men, which would be weird) it's still misses the mark. One packet does very little for flavor with 16 oz of water so you'd have to use two, and WHO drinks just 16 oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature? Also, with only 8 to 12 packets in a box (depends on flavor, who knows why?), that gives you 4 to 6, 16 oz drinks for $3. Not sure it's worth it at all, I'd rather drink lemon water when out than this."
369830,B000084DWM,Meow!,What can I say...this is the only brand of food my cat will eat. She tears into the bag by chewing on it as soon as I get it. I have to pour in into a plastic container. It also controls hair balls.
3641,B005RF029M,Pizza Napoletana Dough Flour ..... Mangia!!,"So this stuff is a must have for making true pizza napoletana.  I'm really thrilled that it is so accessible here in the USA.  This flour makes the most silky smooth dough I've ever had the pleasure of getting sticky with, and it has a different (better for pizza) taste than the all-purpose store brand flour.  Sure It costs a little more, it's coming from Italy, but given that you can make about 6 pizzas per bag ... who's counting?  Get this stuff, some D.O.P. tomatoes, grow some basil, and make some Mozarella (okay, I admit, haven't done this one ... yet) but given the first couple items there and you're well on your way to the origins of pizza in Naples, Italy. Is it worth it??? I say Si!!! Mangia!!! (And Taylor's Market always comes through for my home shipments!... Cheers!)"

3129,B000FDKQCY,"Great, glorious, super, wonderful, delicious bread!!!","I must admit when I first ordered this bread for my new Panasonic bread maker, I was not expecting anything other than potato bread such as I buy at a nearby store. However, was I ever surprised! It was absolutely the best stuff and with some organic butter piled high and properly melted it was on a par with ambrosia. I just could not believe how good it was and is. Since the first loaf, I have made other breads which have been generally excellent but none are quite at the level of this potato bread. It is REALLY good! Perhaps the credit goes to my new bread machine! Highly recommended!!!  GENERAL INFO: The package makes a 1.5 pound loaf. On my machine the recommended setting is BASIC and the loaf bakes in 4 hours. Also, the flour is NON GMO Verified as labelled."
839,B001ELL9X6,Nice flavorful tea for the purist black tea addict,"I grew up on Yunnan tea as a child - it was always my mother's favorite - so I was happy to find an economical source of it of a quality that was great for a ""large volume"" habitual tea drinker like me. This tea is my daily regular tea. Yunnan is nice in that it will brew dark so you do not need much at a time. It's aromatic and flavorful without any additives. If you want something that is flowery yet more subtle than Earl Grey this Yunnan or a Keemun may be a nice option to explore."

44910,B000V1UUZS,Did not like them!  Yuck!,"I did not like them, they seemed flavorless compared to other brands.  The Byzantine olives are a little more, but are a MUCH better product.  I will likely never buy a Roland olive product again, as I was disappointed with their black olives as well."
59103,B002HQLY7S,"Not the worst k cup out there, but there are too many better alternatives to justify this one...","My only foray into Gloria Jean's brand of k cups before this one was when I tried the Hazelnut flavor that was included in the sample pack that was included with our new brewer.  Needless to say, I was unimpressed with it.  I had all but written Gloria Jean off as a weak coffee brand when my boyfriend's sister gave us a few of her Butter Toffee k cups to try out, insisting they were much better than the Hazelnut.  At that point I hadn't tried another butter toffee flavored coffee from any of the other brands, so I figured it was worth a shot.<br /><br />What a letdown.<br /><br />Butter toffee does smell like its namesake when it is being brewed.  I had a lot of hope for it because of how it made my kitchen smell during the brewing process.  The flavor follow-up was nothing short of weak, though.  For one thing, I couldn't detect any butter toffee flavor in the coffee itself at all.  Shame.  The other downside is that, instead of being just a slightly boring, but good cup of regular coffee, this one somehow managed to be bitter and weak at the same time.  Nothing robust or flavorful about it.  Just weak coffee with a terrible aftertaste.<br /><br />So I've only had the chance to try two of Gloria Jean's flavors so far, but I definitely won't be going out of my way to try any others.  I'll stick to Timothy's and Caribou Coffee from now on."

1213,B005O072PC,Tasty and easy to make,I really like this product.  It tasted great and only took a few minutes to make in the microwave.

500591,B003QNLUTI,Hated it!,I tried this product twice and both times it gave me a headache without any added energy. My advice save your money don't even try this product unless you like headaches .
31991,B0062A87HA,What a find!,The organic pumpkin produced pies for Thanksgiving just as well as the national brand I have used for years. One of the cans was slightly dented in shipping. Acceptable as there is no organic pumpkin in the stores around here!
9735,B001LXYA5Q,"Placebo tablets, I think","I and a friend tried these tablets before sampling various kinds of foods we'd seen suggested online, but noticed no effects whatever. We used them as suggested, then even tried multiple tablets at once. Maybe I got a bad batch or maybe we have unusual taste buds, but in any case it was very disappointing. Makes me think I should have tried the berries themselves instead."
232614,B000E243RA,Protein Chips,The Kay's Naturals protein crispy Parmesan  pack of 12 protein chips tasted aweful. I would not recommend them to anyone.
2516,B000RUI0MS,Combo Rose Food/Systemic Insecticide,"This is a great product, so it's no surprise that the local shelves are often cleared of it, especially early in the season. Purchasing in bulk through amazon.com is a dependable alternative. Bayer 2-in-1 in granular form feeds roses and flowers while protecting them with a systemic insecticide for up to 6 weeks, but you'll need a separate fungicidal/disease treatment, and the systemic would not be something one would apply to anything edible. Bayer assures me the product is safe for pollinators and earthworms."
5760,B003TIVBSU,Best deal on the internet!!,I was amazed with how fresh these are and there are so many in 1/2 a pound.  My only suggested would be if you have another person that loves them as much as you do you could split the cost and the beans.  I have so many left over beans I've been giving them away to grateful coworkers but what goes around comes around so here's to awesome ingredients!
7240,B001HTE5HM,"Tasty, healthy snack","Sticks and Twigs may seem a little pricey compared to regular pretzels, but the bag lasts a long time and the ingredients, like flax seeds, quinoa, chia seeds and curry, are good for you. They are very crunchy, but tasty. For some added protein, I like to dip them in peanut butter."

62081,B000CQG8K8,Stash brand teas: A personal favorite for 10+ years,"If you enjoy Earl Grey tea, once you try ""double bergamot"" you will be a customer for the rest of your life. Personally, I ""brew"" the tea using the following method:<br /><br />1. Fill cup with water, leaving enough room for milk and sugar after brewing (if you use those items).<br /><br />2. Put the bag in the cold water cup and microwave for about 2 minutes.<br /><br />3. Remove from microwave and allow to steep another minute.<br /><br />4. Remove bag, add sugar & milk.<br /><br />Enjoy"
329258,B003VXHGE6,Horrible,This stuff tasted like pipe tobacco smells. My Son didn't like it either and I ended up throwing it out.
38374,B000V96C4I,Best Trail Mix Ever,"I hate raisins!  I love tropical fruits.  This is one of the few trail mixes that doesn't have raisins, and it's absolutely terrific.  So tasty, it's like dessert (in fact, some nights it IS dessert).  I stick it in my golf bag and snack on it when I get droopy on the course.  Can't recommend it enough."
10723,B000NMG99Q,Just like I remembered!,"I remembered these honey candies from when I was a child, and ordered a box.  They were exactly like I remembered--great honey flavor and liquid center.  I shared them with friends and family, and am ordering my second box. I also like them for when I have a cold or allergies and have that throat tickle. This is the hard candy you'll find in my purse!"

It had great flavor, and a sufficient energy kick. It wasn't that bad for you compared to Monster products. It's sad to see it go."
7945,B004Q6J4GU,Terrific Decaf Tea,"My Mom was born in Manchester, England,and I have been drinking tea since I was very young. A few years ago I was forced to switch to decaf tea. Most of the blends available are terrible. I used to drink regular Yorkshire tea, and was thrilled to discover they had a decaf blend and it is a strong, full-bodied tea, and I love it! I decided to purchase from Amazon because I knew I could count on them, as  well  as their outside vendors. I was very pleased with the transaction and would purchase from them again."

50970,B00139C3P2,"good product, too pricey here","even the less expensive flavors, at the discounted subscription price, are more expensive than I get them at the local grocery store<br />people will say you save on gas for the trip, but I go to the store anyway, so no savings there, really"
5476,B00622CYVI,Great Flavors,The flavor combinations are good and taste pretty good too.  I did not give it 5 stars because I thought the consistency of the pears was a bit thin and runny for stage 2.  That is easily solved if you mix the fruit with some cereal.  My little girl loves them.
8257,B000E15DFM,Very crunchy and tasty but not organic,"My family loves the taste of these.  They're a bit high in sodium for my liking and for the price, I wish they were organic.  I have purchased the Heart to Heart brand, but they taste much staler and have a strange aftertaste compared to these crackers.  Too bad, because Heart to Heart has half the sodium."
23328,B001E96JY2,worst thing i have ever eaten! by far!!,"i love chicken teriyaki and sesame chicken heatlhy choice meals, so i figured i would give this a try. BIG MISTAKE. the rice does cook the be nice and fluffy but the sauce and chicken taste horrible. for one there is not enough chicken in it and the sauce was far to overwhelming. had trouble swallowing it and threw the rest away. Yuck!!"
488401,B0013A0QXC,Price is too steep,These guys are making a killing on here! We were getting the 18 pod package locally for three bucks and some change!!!!
4873,B001TY6T6K,The other reviewer is totally right!!!,You can get these SOOOOOOOOOOOOO much cheaper at wholesale clubs.<br /><br />I get the 24/20oz(yes 20oz!) for $11 or $12!! Its actually even cheaper then buying the bottles from the regular store!
7750,B001E5DZTS,Great product and timely delivery,I am very pleased with my recent purchase of Meyeberg powdered goat milk.  I have shopped around locally and this is by far the best price per can I could find.  It was delivered as promised.
4629,B000FFRY3G,Great value for the cost...,How can you go wrong with buying these in bulk for less than $3 per unit when they can run as high as $5 per unit retail?
8225,B000BXUVYG,My Cats Love It!,"Not exactly sure whether it really mediate hairball issue because my short hair Russian Blue rarely vomits while my mixed medium hair toby vomits quite frequently, regardless of the treat. Nevertheless, my cats do love it greatly, always rushing to me whenever I grab it."
7564,B002UQ7NP2,Couldn't stand the taste or smell,"I almost never write reviews, but I thought I would for this one.  I'm pretty open to tastes of anything, but something about the smell and taste of this product was really bad.  It tasted ""off"" almost.  I'm really disappointed because I had hoped to like it and I love fruity green teas, but this was NO GOOD.  I'd strongly recommend trying a sample of this (if possible) before buying.  Sorry Zhena's.... maybe I'll like another flavor.  I haven't given up on you yet."
31580,B003ZXJ9EW,Great buy,"I got these wholesale for $6 or so, and my roommate and I have been gnawin' on them for over a month."
4489,B001EHDMY4,very disapointed,Trader Joe's Pomegranate White tea is superior to this tea. This is very bitter and perfumey. Maybe thats what you get when you brew whole leaves and stems . I found it repulsive.
10606,B0079YAR3U,What's with the price??,"I like this coffee, but $37 for two 12-ounce bags? I can get it online from Walmart or even from my local grocery store for $7-9 per 12-ounce bag. Geez."
4449,B002YZESWU,Fantastic for the experimental chef!,"This is such a great product from subtle flavors and aromas for delicate dishes to smokey salts for hearty cooking, this is a great product for the chef who loves flavor and experimenting in the kitchen.  This is such a cool product!!"

I notice that his coat is shinier since he has been eating this.
37902,B000F6SNPS,"Tasty, Very Sweet","This is a very tasty tea for the winter.  But, if you let it steep to long it can get so sweet it will make your teeth hurt.  The list of ingredients listed in Amazon's blurb seems improbable.  It has a strong, complex cinnamon flavor. I recommend this tea for those who like cinnamon teas and are disappointed by how thin some of them taste."
1506,B003UIDAHY,Good!,"Each box is 8oz and usually I make 8oz mixed with some lean protein for a meal for both my husband and I, and if we have leftovers, it's rare.  This time however, I had half of it leftover only b/c we felt full and couldn't eat anymore.  I wonder if this is b/c of the high amt of fiber. Whatever, this morning my hubby tells me he's down 3 lbs. too.  I'm jealous. Also, I've been on an eating binge almost 2 weeks, always feeling unsatiated. Last night I had no strong urges to eat snacks.  I ate an apple more out of habit to eat something than b/c I was truly hungry. I won't say this is the outcome for everyone, but I thought I'd share.  I'm using the leftover pasta in my bean soup tonight. I'd like to eventually try the different varieties of shapes of pasta now, too."

But then again...who can resist bacon flavor?"
8827,B00060PTLO,homemade caramel macchiatos!,"I bought this from safeway for about $5. It's awesome in making those homemade iced caramel macchiatos that cost $4 at starbucks! :)<br /><br />(I don't know if it's just me, but it has this slight chocolatey aftertaste to it that's just absolutely divine)"
784,B0018DQFPC,Spongetastic!,My son is a SB fanatic so I was so excited to find this for the 2010 holiday season as every year we do some version of gingerbread. I knew by reading reviews that there wouldn't be enough yellow frosting so I whipped up so edible glue (water and confectionery sugar) to hold the levels of gingerbread that make the pineapple and save the yellow frosting for the outside - this worked great. It was a really fun idea that we enjoyed creating. The licorice was worthless though...
189162,B0029K11EI,Peter,"Apparently the seller, atoz4less2012, does this a lot. I received 2 bags of ground coffee and 1 bag of whole bean, all well past their sell-by date."
76376,B001HTKOWC,Stash fails splendidly this time.,"The flavors you immediately notice after the first sip of this tea, are hisbiscus flowers and chamoile. The Pomegranate and Raspberry flavors and the green tea are all buried and very faint! If you are looking for a tea to wind down your hectic life, this is not a bad tea at all. If you are looking for an excellent blend of Pomegranate and Raspberry flavors in green tea, you maybe be very disappointed like I do."
16902,B001LGGH40,Too sweet for me,"I like the idea behind this product, but the taste was just too sweet for me, and it has a strange aftertaste. While it has no added sugar or corn syrup, there are plenty of calories (135 for an 8.3 ounce can) and carbs. Also, looking at the price, I think it is way too expensive-almost a dollar a can. I would chose flavored seltzer over this any day."
2555,B000ED9LDU,Healthy Goodness,"I've recently started drinking green smoothies to get healthier and had read that flax seeds have terrific health benefits such as lowering your blood pressure and cholesterol. I add a tablespoon of chia seed and flax seed to my smoothies every day and since drinking my fruits and vegetables I feel better, lost some weight and have stopped having heart flutters. I'm now looking forward to having my next blood work done to see how well it has helped. Highly recommend to anyone wanting to get healthy an all natural way!"

When I read the list of ingedients on the package for the treats, I was stoked.  These crunchy little morsels are packed with nutrients and small enough to use for training without having to break them.<br /><br />The only downside is the smell... but they *are smoked salmon treats after all.  An added bonus is that they seem to digest well (unlike cheese and some other lamb-based treats I've tried)."
513009,B000EPUCSQ,I Grew Up On This Tea!,In England babies have this mixed with their milk formula and then in the younger years its customary to drink cups of this nectar. YAHOO TYPHOO!
323073,B000EDG4V2,Replacement for Xanthan?,I wouldn't try to use this as a replacement for Xanthan gum.  However; it does work quite well if you use it with xanthan gum.  For example if a recipe calls for two teaspoons of xanthan I might use gaur gum for one of those teaspoons.

11302,B000N648OA,DELIGHFUL SAYS THE GROUP,"I have 5 cats, of whom 4 live inside and 1 is outside. It is quite difficult to find one food that appeals to this myriad of tastes. Seems like someone has a ""no thank you,"" ""are you kidding me"", ""not on your life'"" or a plain ""yeech!"" on any choice i see that looks just delightful.But no, I am the human Momcat and my tastes are just not the same of those as the princes and princesses in my care.<br /><br />But Merrick Grammys Pot Pie Cat Food has hit the rare airy quality of being one of the few foods that is eaten by everyone, all the time, each time it is served. That is a heady rating. There are only a couple of other foods which have reached that level at our house. One is the White Meat and Chicken by Pro Plan.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ODAS9M"">Pro Plan White Meat Chicken & Vegetable Entree Adult Canned Cat Food in Gravy</a> The second is Salmon and Chicken by Tiki<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AN8JDK"">Tiki Cat Consomme, 8-Pack, 6-Ounce Can, Napili Luau Wild Salmon and Chicken in Chicken</a>The Third is Tilapia by Fancy Feast.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OPQDDY"">Fancy Feast Appetizers for Cats, Steamed Tilapia, 2-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 10)</a>.<br /><br />So of all the cat foods I buy, only four are always eaten, by everyone, all the time and Grammys pot pie is one of them. SO the kitters have asked me to try some other flavor by Merrick. I will try, for their sake...for them anything...but I doubt a raging success. Some things always look great at the start, but then do not make it to the ""all the time, every time, every one"" category.<br /><br />But, my guys give this 5 stars and say ""thank you"" for reading what we think: Gabriella, Trinity, Wisdom, Mercy, and Yellow Kitty. It is a 5 star meal for us and we think your kids will like it also, so give it a try...""you know, for their sake, or however she says that."" ""We agree on this Merrick!!!"""
8125,B0019GVYR2,They're all aluminum free.,"Arm & Hammer's baking soda is aluminum free, they just don't write it on their packaging.<br /><br />I wasn't sure so I called them and they said there is no aluminum in it, and they would have to state it if there was because people take the product internally.  This leads me to believe that there just isn't aluminum in baking soda.  And researching it showed me that there might have been in the past, but not anymore and not for a long time.<br /><br />I resent that Bob's Red Mill writes ""Aluminum Free"" on their package and then charges a premium for their product.  It's also arsenic free, I hope.  If they label it ""Arsenic Free"" will we assume other brands aren't?  I don't like that kind of marketing."

167215,B002FC2DYW,Are you serious with this price?,"$39.99 for 12 bottles?  That's $3.33 per bottle, PLUS shipping!!!  I can buy a bottle of this stuff in my local grocery store for $1.50 a piece!  I shop online for DEALS, not to be robbed."
386413,B008N8FD30,Rip off-Do not buy,$23 for 16 discs when it is only $8.99 from Tassimo.  Could have sworn that the description indicated that one order is for 2 packs.  What a rip off!!!

306,B001UJEN6C,So awful I can barely describe,"This is the first time I've really been misled by other reviews on amazon. I like 5-hr Energy, I find Rain ok and so I thought I'd try this product based on the reviews. Boy am I sorry! I gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched (really). And it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards. 8 tic tacs at once did not get rid of it! But worst of all, within an hour I was yawning and drowsy. Unless you really like things that taste of a weird tea-flavored cough syrup and don't work, don't buy this! I don't know what to do with the other 11 bottles. big fail"
118196,B0054TWQMM,pretty useful and quite tasty,"I had never tried cooking with chia seeds before.  They work well as a thickening agent for vegan recipes, especially for sauces.  You can use them in any meal in which you might use wheat germ, to add a similar crunch or grittiness.  They are not especially low-calorie, however!"
1513,B003UIDAHY,FANTASTIC,I am on a low carb diet and have lost 25 pounds.  I was so tired of eating meat all the time but too nervous to splurge on pasta until I came across this product on Amazon.  I cook it a minute or two longer than the directions and top it with full fat Greek yogurt and parm cheese and one serving is so filling and yummy.  Definitely cures my cravings and am now on subscribe and save.  My hubby and son love it too!
12161,B00141UC9I,my dog's favorite treat,"my german shepherd loves these.  he's very picky about both his food and treats so it was a relief to find something he likes.  the package recommends giving him 4-6/day but that seems excessive--usually two or three throughout the day makes him happy.  they are in small strips, much like jerky--much less disgusting than some of his other treats, such as pigs feet/ears.  i will definitely continue to purchase."

My puppy was 2.16 lbs at 7 weeks and tiny, so having something that is small enough for him to chew. At 5.5 months old, he still enjoys it. I also like that this small bag is resealable and helps with keeping it fresh."
4175,B004391DK0,Keep this stock on my shelf,I recently went gluten free and this is one of my favorite mixes.  I used it for biscuits and pancakes and it's very good.  You can also use it for pizza dough and to make fried chicken - it's about average for that.

After trying several foods and making all my own dog food we tried Paul Newman and all was well, Maggie and her friends thrived. Well Our grocery stores did not always have it in stock and it ranged from 13 to 17 dollars for 7 pounds, also at Wal Mart is was past its expiration date and rancid. Thank you Amazon, it comes fresh!It is so reasonably priced and it gets delivered on schedule which I can change at anytime as far as amount and delivery date. I cannot thank you enough for carrying this food nor recommend it enough for other dogs.Our lives are busy, I am a nurse and anything that is dependable, easy, reasonable, comes with excellent customer service, and my friends Maggie, Lucy, and Honey stay healthy on it a gift for every day, Thank you"

73066,B005ZZLKU4,Not worth it,Product contains 10% coconut water which cannot be tasted due to the failed attempt to accentuate the flavor with a few of the added ingredients (namely gum arabic and stevia extract). The flavor is not refreshing and has a more rosy taste than the usual quenching taste of coconut water.
977,B001EQ4DVQ,Simple. Convenient,I live in the dorms without a kitchen so making a cup of coffee was really easy with this. Especially when I need to stay up late to study or to wake up after 2 hours of sleep. Its just like making tea and tastes decent enough. Not starbucks but good enough with some sugar and cream.
197983,B0081XIASW,Fun way to feed your dog,My dog loves it. I feed her using the star and she loves trying to separate each level to get to  the food.
1743,B001RVFDOO,Pop chips variety,It is simple. These chips taste great and are a healthier alternative to other brands. Way better than anything baked! I highly recommend them!
8730,B003VXFK44,one of the better K cups I've tried,love this Rodeo Drive it has a very drinkable taste is also good and it is smooth! I recomend that you try this one.
457076,B000F6GZDA,RIP OFF...,"This ""deal"" is a rip off when you can get 2/$1 at the store. And you get to pick which types of Planters you want."
393487,B0002ASM94,Always satisfied,I have purchased these nylas on numerous occasions. These bones have always held up well with my smaller dogs. For some reason the dogs will always chew on just one side.
49146,B0029O0XGQ,Favourite,"My cat will not eat any other dried food but this I've tried a few others but to no avail, even though this is meant to be a treat I leave it down for her all the time"
15053,B008P18ZYO,Sub-par,"I bought these seeds in the hope they would be what I'm used to.  I'm sorry I did.  The seed pods are EXTREMELY small, they're a re past prime, and somewhat bitter than normal cardamom.  Disappointed with this product from this seller."
8205,B003ALJTNU,NO RESPONSE!!!,"I got sent the wrong item, which happens i know.  I tried to contact the company multiple times with no response.  I finally had to contact amazon and they are returning the item for me..."
358002,B002UL8N24,good,Gave these to my Dad for his birthday and he had them gone in no time. He thanked me for them a couple times.
3435,B005K4Q1VI,Bad Taste,"I ordered this product because of a good price deal.  Amazon shipped accordingly, absolutely no problems there.  However, the taste of this product was horrendous.  It tasted as if someone through chemicals in a cup and told me to brew it.  I personally will go back to buying Swiss Miss in a can and just using the Keurig to give me Hot Water, cheaper and much better tasting."
415195,B00850F0BG,Tastes awful..works great!,I got a sample of this stuff and I must say it tastes horrid. I'm used to energy shots and drinks but it is just not one I'd drink again even though it works!
47829,B002X4APX8,CONTAINS PROPYLENE GLYCOL,PROPYLENE GLYCOL is the second ingredient on the product label.  PROPYLENE GYCOL is not indicated as an ingredient on the product page.  PROPYLENE GLYCOL is used in anti-freeze and aircraft de-icing fluids.
8305,B003VXFK44,A strong yet bitter brew,"As a French Roast fan, I bought this brand of K-cup with high expectations, considering the name attached to it. I was disappointed. It has a hearty aroma and full-bodied flavor but leaves a bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />If you're a lover of the more robust roasts, I would recommend trying the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L41Y8A"">Coffee People Kona Blend Island Style, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> instead. It is a smooth blend with none of the bitterness that delivers that kick you're likely looking for."
5734,B003TIVBSU,70 Beans in My Package,"I ordered and got this the next day. Planning to make vanilla for Christmas presents [...]). There were 70 beans in my package - THATSALOTTABEANS - I split it with a friend because I don't think I know 70 people who love to bake. . . On their own, they smell somewhat like raisins, but in the package, the smell is heavenly. Crossing fingers that the vanilla works out! but at what, 40 cents a bean, I haven't lost much and the price is so much better than the grocery store, where I looked at 2 beans for $12."
26063,B0058AMY74,Not  Very Creamy or Chivey...,"I really love Kettle brand chips, but these are rather disappointing. There is very little sour cream or onion flavor."
4426,B000E5AO8O,Fresh Soft Candy,"Best Bit-O-Honey I have ever eaten.<br />I have always bought this product at a local grocery store and it was always hard, I figured it was suppose to be that way. But after eating the box I bought here I now know better; the candy was soft and delicious.<br />I plan to continue buying Bit-O-Honey from here."
37084,B003S61LZQ,Misleading on size/price,"I ordered three bags, not realizing they were 4 lb. bags.  The add made me think it was a 33# bag because the price of 50 something dollars was slashed through like this was some big sale.  I fell for it, but you can believe I will be a lot more careful in the future.  I have bought quite a bit from Amazon and it makes me unhappy that they would let this go on.  If someone would mislead on size/price, what else would they mislead you on."
350612,B002OL2MWM,essential tool!,Once you've used an aerator for reds you'll never be without one again. We use this one on the tower at home and have another (without tower) for traveling.
8286,B003VXFK44,YUMMY,We always drink Timmothy's or Emeril's. Thought we would try something different. Not too many decafs to choose from. We were pleasantly surprised that this had a great taste with a full bodied flavor. I like my coffee on the milder side so I can even get 2 cups from 1 Kcup.
45634,B0041NYV8E,Not for me,I'm not a huge ginger fan but its okay and I love lemon so I decided to try this. I was highly disappointed with this drink. The taste is awfully bitter and spicy. There is so much ginger in this that it actually made my tongue burn and I only used a half of packet. I can't imagine the burning sensation if I would of used an entire packet of this stuff.  It also leaves a nasty bitter aftertaste in my mouth. I took one sip of this and that is all I could take of it. I wanted to like this drink but it's just not for me.<br /><br />The only good things I can say about Gold Kili beverage is that it's an instant drink and it mixes up really well in your glass.
4962,B001DW2RGO,Wow! Rocket fuel for humans,"This stuff will give you a marked energy boost. Note that every person is different.  For me, this lasted 3 hours before the crash.  (Not a sugar crash.) But my heart was pounding like it wanted to burst through my chest.<br /><br />So I only drink half at a time (like another reviewer) and it works, without the scary heart acceleration.<br /><br />It's even tasty."
81226,B000UA2MW4,It does not taste like walnuts,"It doesn't taste like walnuts, plain and simple. It tastes like paper glue loaded with alcohol. And I got heartburns afterwards. Who knows what is in this. I really regret buying this, what a waste of money."
5700,B001QZW13W,Patchi Love,"My first exposure to Patchi choclates was in Abu Dhabi, where Patchi stores are found aplenty. Now that we are back in the States, Amazon is the only place I've been able to find Patchi. Hooray! The chocolates are as rich and delicious as I remember. If you have never enjoyed Patchi chocolates - do yourself a favor and buy some!"
2641,B0016FY6H6,ice tea,"THis ice tea, is like heaven on ice.  must try if you love lemon and giger.  Great price for the content.  You can make a pitcher with 4 bags and add some lemon and whatever your sweetner you prefer.  Great for barbeque parties or a tea with the ladies"
61136,B000FA38ZY,"LOVE Mallowmars, just not this box","I have been a Mallomar fan since I was a kid.  They were always a special treat that we truly enjoyed.  Honestly, I don't know if this is a new formula, if they changed any ingredients, or cut back on using tastier ingredients.  Upon opening this box, I could see that something was amiss.  They weren't as dark as I recall, almost looking aged, or old, although that's really not possible since production only starts up in the fall.  My first bite was also a disappointment.  I couldn't really taste the chocolate, or the marshmallow.  The graham cracker tasted awful and was a lot dryer than I remember.  Some of the cookies were broken and separated from the graham cracker.  I will be purchasing a box locally to see if production has declined or if I just received a bad box.  I'll post back with my findings.<br /><br />EDIT:  Purchased a box yesterday at Shoprite and the first cookie out was mouth watering, as it should be.  Perfect blend of chocolate, marshmallow, & graham crackers that I remember.  This indeed was just a bad box..."
7187,B001EO5YHK,Great Spice!,"If you want HOT peanuts, this is your product.  I have tried several other brands, and these peanuts seem to pack the most punch and have a fantastics taste."
212691,B00020HHAO,"Don't pay for ""expedited"" delivery","I paid over $13.00 for ""expedited"" delivery and the product still took FIVE days to arrive. Would not buy from them again."
13327,B001BSBFUO,Jack loves these,"These are basically moldable bits of chicken putty, and my liver-spotted dalmatian Jack loves them. Every morning he takes a big fish oil capsule that he thinks is weird on its own and two pills. I tear one of these pill pockets in half, then mush one half of the half around the fish oil and mush the other pills into the other half of the half, and he gobbles it all up without complaint. I'm stingy with these, because they get a little expensive when you have to use them every day, but they really are just the thing for getting a dog to take medicine. I'd use as many of them as necesary to get Jack to take his meds, but so far the economy approach is working. Great product!"
184934,B00171417E,These burgers are irradiated,I just cannot believe that Omaha Steaks has been irradiating their burgers since February 2000.<br />Here is their link of proof:<br />[...]
3221,B005K4Q1VI,good hot cocoa,It tastes good and is little sweet so my first thought was that it had a lot of sugar.  I looked on the box and was surprised that it did not have that much. (a plus for me)
179018,B003QCMDCW,I heart truffle oil,I heart truffle oil.  I heart it on popcorn.  I heart it on vegetables.  I heart it on English muffins.  I heart it on potatoes.  I heart it on just about everything.
25989,B001IZJO76,The Kids love it,I myself am not a great fan of buble gum sinced it loses its flavor quickly but the sugar free is even worse.  For the kids they do not care and like that they can blow bubbles.  I like it because it will not rot their teeth.
69157,B0018KR8V0,Love them. Yummy combination of flavors,"Cocoa and a little spice. Well, might be a ,little too spicy for some. But, I loved them. They're just so expensive!"
71042,B0018E7GM2,Great care package!,"When our girls went to summer camp, we were trying to figure out what to put together to send as a care package. We would have to have sent it the day they left in order for it to get to them before they left camp. We found this on my Amazon mobile app, had it shipped with 2 day Amazon Prime, and they had it half way through thier stay....Awesome!"
1769,B001RVFDOO,popchips r hella good,Variety pack of popchips r sooo good all flavors r delicious and r way healthier than regular greasy potato chips....popchips r half the fat and only 100 calories so a def must buy
203149,B002OFZMPW,Soldiers love it,We support a number of soldiers deployed to Afghanistan and several of them request peppered jerky above everything else.
45479,B0000GL6RU,Not varied like shown,I ordered this to try all the different types of drink and I was sent a lot of watermelon and strawberry and 1 hibiscus. The drinks also do not mix well and are clumpy.
33930,B00412W76S,Not even close...,"This was a waste of money, the item was late, package was torn up,and the tea was terrible, not a good product in my opinion and bad handling."
46402,B002GJ9JWS,Overpriced on Amazon,Strange pricing on Amazon when you can get 4 for $15.96 at the company's site that makes this (Bell Plantation).
1369,B0013JQON4,Great for GF Baking,My sister is alergic to wheat so I make her a lot of Gluten Free foods.  I searched local stores and could not find Sorghum Flour.  So I looked on Amazon and finally found it.  It was all packed wonderfully and arrived perfectly fine and I'm already using it.
169281,B0001ES9FI,Great product/cheaper elsewhere,"After I had ordered and received several boxes of this item, I found them cheaper at the local supermarket.  Won't be ordering this from amazon again!"
275217,B000CQID7E,SOY,This is the only herbal or decaf tea I have ever had that has soy. I am alergic to soy and am now stuck with 5 boxes of tea I can't use.
113041,B000LKXBL4,Good chips,I don't know what to say that others have not covered. If you like potato chips you will like these. Get em on sale when you can and limit your intake...if you can...
8676,B003VXFK44,Can't offer much guidance,"I ordered the vanilla coffee for my college age children.  Unfortunately, there were shipping delays and it did not arrive until the kids had returned to college for the Fall semester.  Update to come when they finally come home for a break -- it may be a while.  The other coffees I have ordered have all been tasty and a very good value, I have no reason to believe this will be any different. I can say that the k cups and the Keurig have been delightful.  I enjoy having a freshly brewed cup every time and like that I save a bunch of money by brewing at home into a travel mug rather than stopping to drop $2.00 for a cup on the way to work.  Saves all those styrofoam cups too!"
14241,B0045XE32E,Not for small dogs!,"Just a few observations here: 1) We have a small chihuahua. These are way too big for her. We basically have to crush them to crumbs for her to eat them. Otherwise she carries them and hides them like bones, and, trust me, it's no fun to find to find a slobbery lamb/barley biscuit under your pillow when you go to bed! 2) What the heck is barley doing in a dog treat? It doesn't seem to me that dogs were designed to graze in barley fields, so why are we feeding them barley? 3) My dog seemed to really enjoy the flavor, so these at least have that going for them."
29497,B000PDY3P0,Popcorn,"We have a 4 oz stand up electric popcorn popper and find 4 oz bags a little hard to come by. This popcorn, salt and oil is 6 ozs and work perfectly in out 4 oz popper. About 80 to 90% of the grains pop and that is our only complaint. We have tested the kettle at very hot and at start up tempatures and there is still at least 10% of the grains unpopped. What are we doing wrong?"
61676,B003P9XG8Q,"blue buffalo dry cat food, basic recipe","Wonderful company...fabulous quality, but gave my cat diarrhea. I was disappointed because he suffers from terrible gas and I tried this food with him to try to eliminate that, and it did...it was a miracle, but after waiting and waiting to see if his diarrhea would clear up, I finally had to take him off it because the mess was just awful. Have him back on original, chicken and brown rice recipe...still has terrible gas :( Any suggestions? He really could clear a room!"
59639,B000W5SLB8,Be Wary,"Our two-year-old lab, who will eat anything (almost literally), won't touch this stuff. Even when we tried mixing it with food he was used to, he just ate around the Taste of the Wild...which is hard to do since the kibble is so small in size. After reading other reviews, we thought we'd try this stuff out, to give our pup a change of pace. Well, now we have a full, 30-pound bag of the stuff...wonder if there are any other uses for it? A door-stop maybe?"
306038,B002FJU0VS,GROSS!!!,"I can't believe I actually paid money for this stuff. It's gritty, tastes NOTHING like cheese in the least, and no one in our family of 4 ate more than one bite. Don't waste your money."
67683,B007OXJK3Y,yuck,This coffee has a yucky cardboard flavor to it.  There are 4 coffee drinkers in our house and none of us like it.
36098,B007C64DTO,Yuck,"Yuck....nastiest Pina Colada mix I have ever tasted in my life....and I have been a bartender for over 20 years. Left a terrible after taste in all of our mouths. I have traveled all over the tropics and have never tasted a Pina Colada as nasty as these. Go with ""Bacardi frozen mixers"" in your grocery store's freezer section. Now that is the best tasting Colada mix you will ever have....I guarantee it."
444688,B000RHVJT2,DELICIOUSLY FRESH,FRESHEST SPICES I HAVE EVER BOUGHT<br />CAME FROM ANGELINA'S ON AMAZON!<br />GREAT PRICES - PROMPT SERVICE!
17007,B001D6MQCU,Old and Dented,I was disappointed with my order of 2 cans of Coopers LME. One can expired one month before I recieved it. The other can was newer but very dented and damaged. I will not be ordering cans of liquid malt extract from here again.
69925,B0043ODAAG,Salty,I have tried several coconut water brands and this one was way too salty. I tried to adjust the water to CocoHydro ratio but still salty.
7436,B002GWMCIS,Chocolate Raspberry flavor,I was surprised how much raspberry flavor the coffee has.  The coffee has a nice aroma and a suddal chocolate flavor.  I will get this flavor again.
80400,B0009XPD64,Horrible,"My dog was eating this food and has had bad gas, bloody and loose stools.  We have stopped giving this to him but we are still trying to get his tummy troubles under control.  All blood tests, stool tests, and urine tests have come back OK."
324031,B001BLX7DE,Not what you pay for.,"Website states item is 6x5x4; item is actually 4x1, and only slightly larger than a tube of lipstick.<br /><br />Item is also supposed to be .23c per oz, but is actually $10.94 per ounce."
4569,B002TMV3E4,Best Decaf EVER,"Soon as I got this bag of decaf I made a big mug and it filled my house with the wonderful aroma of high quality fresh brewed coffee.  It is very finely ground but I still used the same amount I normally do and it turned out great.  I added some soy milk, sat back, and enjoyed my rare treat of an after-noon coffee break!!!  Definitely will buy some of this for the winter months so I can treat myself to excellent hot coffee any time of the day or night!"
72407,B001E6K6GW,Sent very close to expiry date!!!!,Got them at a good price through GOLD BOX DEAL OF THE DAY. But we were very disappointed to find out they expire in 1 month. We can't eat 6 boxes in 1 month!!! Sneaky Amazon!!!!!
94113,B0002DGRPC,Dogs Love It,I've been buying this product for over 10 yrs.  It is a special<br />treat and reward for our dogs - I will continue buying this.
4558,B002TMV3E4,very tasty,"What can you say about coffee, either you like it or you don't. I liked this coffee, although when I choose to review it I didn't notice it was decaf. That aside, it tastes fine (made in my Keurig) but if you want the kick get the caffeinated one."
40082,B001E50X66,Dried out little rocks for the most part,These prunes were not what I was expecting from Sun Maid. When I buy them locally they are plump an as juicy as a dried fruit can be. These came in a 4 pack and most of them were dried up little hard nuggets. Not very good at all. Will go back to buying them locally I guess.
8327,B003VXFK44,My favorite of the WP K cups.,Nice round flavor. Not harsh or botter. I enjoy it with French Vanilla creamer.  Lately it has been harder to find.  I do hope they have not discontinued it!
16637,B001LGGH40,GOOD TASTING,I liked this flavor of theis carbonated fruit juice but I will admit that there are flavors I did like better.Also this product should be drunk very cold for maximum flavor.If you like carbonated fruit juice then this product is for you
271500,B004YWHTBS,Amazing bar! Too expensive @ amazon!,Why is the box of 10 $10 @ Amazon when I can buy this for $4 at the grocery store? Is there a pricing problem?
2700,B004Z8F1JI,decent but Monin is better...,"I wanted to love this but I just didn't. Despite being sugar free it has 15 calories per pump and in my opinion needs three pumps to add enough flavor to my iced vanilla lattes. If your going for calorie count this isn't favorable. I would however say if you think other brands are a bit too sweet or if calorie count isn't overly important you should give it a go, it may be just what you were looking for! As a side note if calorie count is unimportant I recommend their coconut cream flavor<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ZU3JJ4"">Amoretti Premium Coconut Cream Syrup (750mL)</a>, its delicious!"
351417,B002E0UEBE,No card was enclosed,"I was not there to see the products but, the note to be enclosed and sent with the product saying who it was from (this was a gift) was absent. Therefore, it was received without knowledge of who or where it was sent from."
152091,B0045TM54Q,Thank you Amazon,"Now I always have something to bake at the drop of a hat. Plus, it's cheaper than buying them one at a time in the store. Thank you Amazon."
3317,B005K4Q1VI,Yummy!!,"I've tried a few different Hot Cocoa brands for my Keurig... And have been disappointed EVERY time, until now! Cocoa brews smooth and full flavored-on either the small cup size or the medium! I add a splash of almond milk and I'm ready to go :) Perfect! I'll definitely buy this again."
289309,B001O2F5WQ,The Best Product,"I have no children, well I do but they are grown. This was suggested by my dog's vet, the Pumpkin settles their stomach and the apple is just a bonus but she gets a couple tablespoons mixed in her food and she loves it. Yes, I know SPOILED."
7367,B000EDG4TE,Excellent Product,Just excellent product !!!!. I would buy it again. It is better than I was expecting. I do not have any complain about it.
194028,B000JSO76Q,Not as described,The description says that there is an inner lid and an outer lid but there is only one lid. It also says that there are 7 spoons but I only got 2. Would not buy again.
46784,B001EQ4SHK,Wonderful,"I thought I'd up the chocolate factor in my chocolate cake and bought a bunch of Ghirardelli cocoa off this site.  It was terrible.  I came back and this popped up and being a fan of dark chocolate, i thought I'd give it a try.  HEAVEN!  I will be ordering more of this very soon!  YUM"
315300,B007OVX77G,Not a fan,"I love green tea, I love Kit Kats, but the two do not belong together. I hate the after taste of them."
339905,B005OL1Q8K,"Cute, not Great","Product does not taste like bacon, even when tester is told flavor.<br /><br />Sad impluse buy for me, should have gotten the meat wallet.<br /><br />Product arrived in timely manner, as advertised.<br /><br />Item should be considered a novelty and not what it claims."
41547,B005HGIVVW,The brand name says it all...,Too tell the truth all coconut waters are NOT created equal.  I found the flavor to be very subtle without much coconut or pineapple taste.  So yes the brand says it all... naked(bare) of flavor.  I stick to Vita Coco pineapple flavor.
7977,B004WM0ZTS,pricey but good,"I bought this as an experiment to try on a camping trip.<br />After adding hot water, there was a brief 'instant coffee' taste. But that was soon gone and I was left with a real good cup of coffee.  It's too expensive for my budget as a regular item, but I'll definitely include it on future camping trips, and driving trips with stays at cheap motels."
8410,B003VXFK44,"Too much caramel cream, not enough coffee","If you like your flavored coffee to taste like coffee, this may not be for you.  I couldn't taste the coffee at all in the travel size brew, but the smaller brew sizes were a bit better."
1704,B001RVFDOO,Awesome Chips!!!!!!!!!!!,"I picked up a 3 oz bag of the Salt and Vinegar chips last weekend at Wegman's and in a blink of an eye, the bag was GONE.  Very nice vinegar flavor.  Bad side was in a blink of an eye they were gone which is not good for portion control.  I ordered the variety pack in .8 oz size (single serving) to help with portion control.  Most of the flavors I like - but fair warning, the parmesan garlic is VERY garlic. Love the salt and pepper.  With 100 calories a pack, what a nice change from baked chips.  Try it - you will like it."
12947,B004H0ZCI4,Marzipan,Very disappointed with the taste of this product;it really lacks flavor.In the future i will wait until Schluckwerder Marzipan is back in stock.
75902,B001CPOR2E,SmokeHouse USA?!?  Don't Think So...,"I guess if you want to keep raking in the money you have to fudge and mislead folk.  That's what SmokeHouse has done by adding 'USA' to their name.  I can say this without fear because the packages I have sitting on the kitchen table in front of me clearly say that this is a ""Product of China.""<br /><br />You know, the China where they feel free to add melamine to products for human babies (2008), and dogs and cats (2007 and 2010) -- all so that the protein levels register higher than they normally would :(<br /><br />I am so disappointed.  Honestly, my little Jack-a-Bee puppy loves their products, but I won't be purchasing the Chicken Chips or Chicken Breast Strips again.  I can't imagine telling my children that the lively little pup they love was made sick (or died!) because of some cheap-*** short-cut.<br /><br />I'd rather pay more money and have it manufactured here in the States.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/blogger/dog lover"
43397,B0000DJDHK,Keep a chaser handy...,"I love cookies because I'm a fatty.<br /><br />These are not cookies though, they are the cookie version of sin. Ever held sin in tangible form? Well if not these ""cookies"" will do the job! If cookies had a religion, these would be their anti-christ. Hitler could not make a cookie that tasted this bad and look at his cooking attempts. These things taste like you grabbed the shells of peanuts from the floor of a 1930's stadium and shoved them in your mouth with the intent of assaulting your taste buds. Have you ever wanted to assault yours or your friends taste buds? Behold the compact way of doing so! Please keep in mind that a chaser of some type of liquid is a necessity when attempting to eat these. I unfortunately did not have any present and had to man up while trying to over come these dastardly doom disks. Speaking of which, after eating one of these I was compelled to the bathroom by some satanic calling from my belly. Upon making it there I vomited profusely. For the first time in my life, the taste of vomit was welcomed. On that note, these should never be allowed near anyone whom ever was or is bulimic or anorexic as it will give them ever more incentive to vomit.<br /><br />Did you know if you threw these out the window of your car you'd be ticketed for littering? Why? Due to the simple fact that they lack a trait know as biodegradable. Bacterial could not even be bothered to touch these. I could go on and on about how bad these are, but alas I have to finish taking care of these cookies.<br /><br />I'm going to take these and have the bag, with the remainder of the cookies, laminated to seal them in forever. After doing so, I will be shipping these to NATO with the intent of having these cookies be banned from war. I will edit this post upon receiving an update from NATO about these cookies.<br /><br />Little known fact, these cookies were first made in 1986. Know what else happed in 1986? The Chernobyl disaster...yeah think about it."
506224,B0013T5YO4,Too good to be true,Just got the email which informed me of the price increase. And then I canceled my subcription.<br />Good while it lasted (for $25)

5491,B00622CYVI,Organic with BPA,There is BPA in the lids and company claims it doesn't touch the food so it's okey. Why do they even write ORGANIC 6 times around the lid? Not honest to their costumer. I wouldn't even give 1 star if l could.
80720,B0001M0YWQ,Good product,"Frontier product has always been reliable.  The bag of turmeric had a small tear in the side of the bag and the supplier put a piece of scotch tape over the tear to keep it from leaking, which I was a bit skeptic about.  All in all the turmeric is working well.  I am putting it in capsules and using it for pain."
8248,B000E15DFM,Better than the competition!,"I first purchased these crackers because they have no soy in them.  My daughter is allergic to soy, and soy-free crackers are very hard to find.  I bought them, and to my amazement, my picky husband also loves them!  He prefers them to all other similar crackers.  I purchased a large number of boxes (which I keep hidden) as they tend to disappear rather quickly."
8070,B0012KB4M0,"Expensive, Messy and Quick","I had pretty high hopes for the Busy Bone. I have a large, active chewer (the kind of dog that has to have several bones to choose from all the time if you don't want her to chew up your bed frame). I was hoping that with the Busy Bone's 'long-lasting' promise, I might be able to just give her one of these and at least have time to wash the dishes. Why don't I describe what happened next...<br />I was in the kitchen washing the dishes. It had been about fifteen minutes since I'd given the dog the bone. Deeply absorbed in annoyance with myself for not rinsing said dishes, I was scrubbing vigorously when an awful sound met my ears: a terrible and hauntingly familiar crunching noise. The dog was eating my bed. So I go into the bedroom to scold her and even before I get a chance to look at the bed frame, I am struck by the mess she has caused. The Busy Bone somehow leaves little brown crumbles ALL over the floor. Too small and numerous to pick up by hand and too gushy for the vacuum cleaner to clean up, the oobleck has to be washed out of the carpet with a dish rag. And did I mention that they're expensive?<br />I will continue to stick with real bones that I purchase from the butcher. They're cheaper, they last longer, and they don't leave a terrible mess."
12308,B0009XQSAY,Great shelf staple ...,"I used this a lot for white bean / chicken chili, chicken salad, fettuccine alfredo with chicken and mushrooms.  The flavor is very good, it's low-fat, the sodium count isn't outrageous, and it works well with a lot of things.  Yes, I prefer using fresh chicken breast, but when I don't have any on hand or can't get to the store, this works very well."
64703,B000I6625I,couldn't do it better myself,"and I used to.  Growing up in western NY I picked tree ripened sour cherries, pitted and canned them, knowing no canned cherries on the market could compare to the home canned ones.  After moving to southern California and finding that sour cherries won't grow here it took me several years to discover Oregon brand cherries, but in the 32 years since then I won't make a cherry pie with any other kind.  Thank you, Amazon, for carrying them.  So few people cook anymore, it seems, they're getting hard to find."

54009,B000EGZ2L2,Problem Dog Food,"I purchased Canidae Dry Dog Food, Chicken Meal and Rice Formula for my two Cocker Spaniels (Cavalier King Charles and American breed).  After about two weeks, the problems began.  Diarrhea, some vomiting and general malaise.  Further feeding resulted in more problems.  We had fed them Blue Buffalo and Eukanuba in the past but had never experienced these kind of problems. We returned to Eukahuba and both pets have returned to normal. I'm unsure what ingredients caused the problem but I will never use this product again and recommend caution before feeding your dog this food!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EGZ2L2"">Canidae Dry Dog Food, Chicken Meal and Rice Formula, 30-Pound Bag</a>"

1425,B00061NJ06,Vintage Tasting Coffee,"Forget Starbucks, Peets or anything else. This is the real deal. Like a good vintage wine, Britt coffee is truly gourmet with no after taste! I am really fussy about coffee, and generally avoid it, but after a trip to Costa Rica fell in love with the beverage again! You have to use a French Press to get the full favor so throw away those other coffee making contraptions, your beans deserve the best, your taste buds deserve the best too. No I don't work for Britt and did not get paid to say this!!!!!  But if you guys at Britt read this send me a sample or two!!"

Not only is the aroma delightful, the flavor is excellent as well.  I drink my coffee black and this one has no bitter after taste and the flavor isn't overpowering.  The flavor is a very light coconut and the coffee is a medium body.  I must admit that I was a little hesitant about a ""coconut"" flavor.  DON'T BE!  Everyone around me wants a cup....I refuse to share!"

24452,B004R8J8EK,Quick and Easy,"Admittedly I normally would only use breading or flour for my chicken, but that gets messy (what with the eggs and frying and such) and during the summer I had a handful more mouths to feed with my siblings inviting their friends over to eat every other night.  So for me Shake 'n' Bake, which I haven't had since I was at least 10 years old, was the perfect solution.<br /><br />I do however caution that while this worked perfectly well with the full sized chicken breasts, everyone seemed to prefer it more when the chicken was pounded thin.  The chicken came out juicier and less dry and the coating wasn't overwhelmingly salty.<br /><br />As a test group I had three 20somethings (not including myself) and two teens, and made the Shake 'n' Bake with both regular sized breasts and thin cutlets.  Excluding the time it took for me to butterfly the chicken breasts, it took maybe ten minutes total to coat the chicken to our liking and pop it in the oven.  The packaging says to cook the chicken for at least 15 minutes at 425, but I found that cooking it for 20 minutes, and letting it rest for an additional 5 minutes, worked out perfectly.<br /><br />The only complaint received was the saltiness, I didn't season the chicken beforehand (for obvious reasons) and pretty much everyone had assumed I did because the coating was salty.  Point of interest, my sister made a Honey Dijon mustard sauce to dip the chicken into and the coating worked perfectly with that, balancing out some of the sweetness of the honey Dijon."

Also I like that with the jarred foods is you know when you recycle it will never become waste. I just learned this and am telling everyone - only glass recycles forever. And if you don't recycle then you and I have nothing in common and you should stop reading here. It's not even a hard thing to do anymore. Nobody else in my building recycles and it drives me crazy. You just rinse it and put it in a different bin and still put it out on trash day. Stop being lazy.

6453,B000FNEX50,Not a Gluten Free Product,"I am celiac and have been keeping a strictly gluten-free diet for over six years, and was excited to learn about this product.  After eating it, [the taste and texture was not bad] I became sick in the way that I always do when ingesting gluten. Nana's also makes non-gluten products, and clearly are not careful about cross-contamination.  If you are concerned about ingesting gluten or keeping a strictly celiac diet, I strongly recommend you avoid this product.  I also think that the company should not deceive their customers, many who suffer from celiac disease, and should more clearly label their product as it is a danger to the health of many who would be inclined to buy this product."
1341,B000I5DJVE,Gluten-free bliss!,"Wow--this was the first licorice I'd had in two years after being diagnosed with Celiac disease.  That was one of the hardest things to give up!  These are nice--not exactly like the real thing, but close enough.  There are many companies that call their product ""licorice,"" but they are merely rip-offs of ""Dots"" candy: i.e. nothing like real licorice--very gooey and stick to your teeth.  These are quite firm, more like older licorice, but still a great chew.  It satisfied me and my craving for ""real"" licorice."

209,B0028C44Z0,These just don't do it for me as breath mints,"To me, these are nothing like the regular Altoids and are not breath mints. They are pleasant-tasting little candies in a cute convenient tin, and that's as far as it goes. The mintiness is just not strong, and the wintergreens are definitely weaker than the peppermint minis. I'm not a dragon-breath person, but still, one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my breath. Four or five will freshen my breath for a short while - maybe 15 minutes. At this point, I think the Icebreakers Frost mints are the best as sugar free breath mints."

4996,B00653KJ5M,The cavemen must have been wealthy,"I really wanted to like these.<br /><br />First off, these cookies are about the size of a half dollar and aren't that thick. And they are more like fudge that cookies. Look at the ingredients. They are nut flour held together with honey. They need some egg or something. They are gooey and sticky. They are extremely sweet and pack a whopping 10-15g carbs each and yes that is not counting the fiber.<br /><br />I'm sorry I appreciate the effort guys but in my option these are a novetly. They are too expensive and too non-functional to be a serious part of your regular diet."

8298,B003VXFK44,"Good coffee, but lets clear up the flavors?","I saw the good reviews of this Jamaica Me Crazy coffee, but the reviewers all seem to wander around whether it has coconut, vanilla, caramel, rum or coffee liqueur flavorings.<br /><br />First off, I'm not getting any coconut from it at all.  Some vanilla, but it mostly tastes like coffee with baileys irish cream in it.<br /><br />In fact, after I drank a cup I had to go pick up my son from kindergarten and it occurred to me that some of the other parents might think I was drinking spiked coffee while we waited for the class to let out! :)<br /><br />But its good.  I recommend it to anyone who likes flavored coffee.  Not really anything else like it and I've tried about 20 different k-cup flavors."
63940,B0046M4EXM,terrible....,"I bought a total of 96.............for my students and trick-or-treaters.  They are TERRIBLE!!!  Taste like plastic.  They look cool, but lack in flavor big time."
9174,B006N3IG4K,Superb coffee,"I'm actually suprised from reading some of the rants about this coffee.  I have tried 20+ K-cup varieties and this is by far my favorite.  Contrary to some reviews, I don't find it to be weak at all and in fact, is quite bold but with absolutely not hints of being bitter.  Very smooth and leaves a great aftertaste.  I prefer really strong coffee and this is a good compromise for a medium roast as it's not as bold as I would normally prefer but certainly strong enough to satisfy my preferences.<br /><br />I typically drink Wolfgang's Jamaica Me Crazy but ever since trying Rodeo Drive, I haven't gone back."
4155,B004391DK0,Really good Gluten Free Pancakes,"I really like it when my wife makes anything from her Betty Crocker cookbook, so I know when we got the gluten free pancakes that they would be good.

They are great."
62637,B000I1OLT2,delicious.,"I'm picky about my green teas. Sometimes they're too weak, sometimes it just doesn't smell/taste like green tea, or sometimes it's just horribly bitter/sour and unpalatable (think most grocery store teas).<br /><br />But Stash's green tea is TERRIFIC. There's a good element of leafyness (it IS green after all) without much bitter/sourness. I can usually pull at least 2 good cups of hot green tea from each tea bag.<br />I was actually previously disappointed by Yogi's Green tea (it's just purely green tea leaves, can't remember the exact name of it though) - when steeped in hot water it smelled like burnt tires, so I almost lost hope in American grocery store teas. I previously would only buy the Yamamotoyama green teas (slight roasted flavor) and Stash's green tea tastes remarkably similar, which makes me incredibly happy due to the Stash tea sales that have been going on at my local markets. WOO!!!"

I found this product on yelp and went to an herbal Asian store in Chinatown in Phila. I only paid $2.50! the only difference is that I didn't get tea bags they were dissoluble cubes you place in the hot water. It worked great. It took a few hours to work but it worked!. The next day I had my voice back completely and no sore throat. One night I woke up from terrible post nasal drip cough, took a cup of this tea and it eliminated the cough and put me right to sleep. A must buy, its cheap and natural. You cant go wrong if you give it a try."

8746,B000LKZ84C,Convenient,"Following a plant based diet, I use tofu almost daily.  It is expensive to purchase at a store and takes up valuable real estate in my fridge.  These packages sit perfectly on a shelf.  They are a little smaller than standard refrigerated tofu (12 oz vs 16 oz).  They are also silk tofu so they don't hold  their shape as well, which is good for certain things like fried rice or chocolate mousse.  Not great if you are making tofu steaks or strips."
9340,B006N3IG4K,Just OK,"I prefer the ""extra bold"" coffees, so this one really lacking on the flavor.  It's fairly weak, at the smallest cup setting its drinkable, but I won't be buying it again.  I'd recommend the Timothy's World Coffee, Rainforest Decaf Espresso instead."

32273,B000RI8GI8,WHY DOES IT TASTE SPICY??...EWWW,This is the worst energy drink I ever tasted. It has a really big spicy flavor to the drink. The spicy to the drink over powers it and its impossible to even finish one out six. I even tried giving the other five away for free and people would do the same thing I did throw it away. So I really spent about $19.00 down the drain.

7088,B004K30HO2,Why Didn't Someone Think Of This Sooner?,"Empty K-Cups, miniature filters and lids allow you to use your own favorite ground coffee.  If you buy roasted beans and grind your own, this is the solution for you.  One scoop in the K-Cup, put on the lid and pop it into your Kuerig.<br /><br />I shied away from buying a Kuerig because I love my Kenya-AA from Talk 'n Coffee in Deptford, NJ.  They roast it dark, grind it almost to percolator coarseness for me (sigh) and ship it to me here in Florida.  I had tried mesh filters but even with my custom percolator grind, I'd get grinds in the brew.  The special cup holders looked like a labor-intensive solution too so I stuck with my Mr. Coffee.  When I saw the disposable cups on Amazon, I ordered them along with the Keurig.<br /><br />This works great!  A single fresh hot cup of Kenyaa AA dark roast whenever the spirit moves me and no worries about having to make a partial pot for only one cup.  I'll have Talk 'n Coffee grind the beans a little finer for the Kuerig on my next order.  I re-ground my percolator grind a little finer and the portion strength is now perfect for the travel mug size.<br /><br />Kathy buys loose tea and uses the disposable K-Cup for a mug whenever it suits her fancy.  It's a lot easier than the little metal thingie with the chain and waiting for a kettle to boil.<br /><br />One benefit I hadn't counted on is that clean-up is easy and fast - pluck the used disposable K-Cup from the Kuerig and toss it in the trash.  No more having to service the coffee pot!<br /><br />To save time in the morning, I used to set up Mr. Coffee the night before but now I just make up the disposable K-Cups a dozen at a time and we fresh-brew by the cup in the morning for several days running. We actually use less coffee after evaporation and ""who doesn't want the last cup"" considerations.  I think the savings on coffee and Mr. Coffee filters is probably break-even with the cost of the disposable K-Cups so net-net, they seem free.<br /><br />Only one con from me.  It's hard for these arthritic old hands to fit the lid on due to the filter overlapping the top of the K-Cup.  Folding or cutting away the overlap causes grinds in the brew and a clogged lower needle.  I don't think there is a cure without the downside being greater than the problem.  I have found patience and not over loading the K-Cup to be the best solution."

5749,B003TIVBSU,Sour Vanilla Beans,"This product had pretty good reviews so I thought it would be safe to buy 4 packages, so I did. Boy am I full of regret now. I'm stuck with 4 packs of these beans and I can't return any them. The moment I opened the bag, I should've known. It had a stale sour smell to them. But the optimistic side of me said, these beans look fresh and plump, maybe it won't smell like that once I scrape the seeds out. I was wrong. I made two test batches to see if it was the salt I was using to make my vanilla salt but they both have that weird sour, rancid smell. I've made vanilla salt before so I know what it's supposed to smell and taste like. Unfortunately, even after a few days, this smell isn't going away. I was really looking forward to making jars of vanilla salt to give out as cheap gifts. But now I need to go buy more vanilla beans to replace these which is going to end up costing me. I'm so disappointed. I haven't cooked with these seeds so I don't know if the taste and smell transforms with heat or with any other mixed in ingredient. I know for sure though that if you're looking to make vanilla extract, vanilla sugar or vanilla salt, I HIGHLY discourage you from buying this product."

FDA says contaminated!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT OR ANY CHICKEN JERKY TREAT PRODUCT FROM CANYON CREEK RANCH OR ANY OTHER DISTRIBUTOR OF PRODUCTS FROM CHINA UNTIL THE FDA ADVISES THE PRODUCTS ARE SAFE AGAIN. Last month the FDA issued a warning advising people not to buy chicken jerky treats made in China [...]. Unfortunately I didn't hear of the warning until it was too late. I gave both my dogs one Yam-Good each for about a month and the result was they almost died from vomiting and bloody stool. Despite their American sounding name, Canyon Creek Ranch IS MADE IN CHINA AND SAYS SO ON THE PACKAGE. Even worse, no where on their website or on Amazon does it mention the FDA warning or that the product is toxic. These lovely little treats nearly cost me the lives of both my dogs, as well as over $500 in vet bills and time off of work."

7601,B0009EIOPK,Terrible!,"I bought a new bread machine and bought this collection of bread mixes as well as some single mixes to try it out.  The single mixes worked well as they included yeast packaged separately in the mix.  My machine states clearly not to get the yeast wet, to put it on top of the flour away from the water.  The mixes in this collection have the yeast in the flour, not packaged separately.  The bread failed to rise at all.  Why would they package the yeast separately in the single mixes and not in the multi packs?  Along with the Heartland Collection I also purchased the Baker's Choice Collection.  I am throwing them all out.  Don't waste your money."

Not because it's hard to understand how it works just because it's very hard to get the treats out even for me, even when he shakes it. The rope (too thick)prevents the treats from falling out.. and even when I removed the rope, the shape of the bottle makes it difficult as the kibbles roll inside but that's pretty much it, they barely ever get passed the neck. Which makes it a very expensive useless toy, I could have just use a small empty water bottle for no cost!!<br /><br />DO NOT RECOMMEND!<br />Try the kibble nibble instead, I have one and it's way better even if sometimes the treats fall out of it too easily. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005JU18S4"">Busy Buddy Kibble Nibble Food and Treat Activity Ball</a>"

3456,B005K4Q1VI,not quality at all,this product taste stale and is full of artificial ingredients.<br />NO REAL PEPPERMINT IS IN THIS PRODUCT and to be honest it doesnt even taste like real cocoa is either.
1992,B001E5E29A,This is great stuff,I received this mix along with a waffle maker as a gift.  It's so good that I keep buying this same brand mix when I run out.<br /><br />I cut the Farmhouse Waffles recipe in half (so that's 1 cup Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix; 1 egg; 5/8 cup water; 2 tablespoon melted butter) and it's more than enough batter for 2 waffles in a full-size Belgian waffle maker.<br /><br />Easy to make and very tasty.
15036,B003EMQOY2,Not Jelly Belly Sanded Lemon drops,I have purchased these lemon drops for years and the company(Jelly Belly) has discontinued them.  I  bought what I thought was them on Amazon because they are claiming to be the ones from the Jelly Belly Company!  They are not and very disappointed they were misrepresentd as being the original...shame on you.  I now have 10lbs of junk
352119,B000M0F58U,I drink this for arthritis pain...,...and something seems to be working! It could be this alfalfa tea which tastes just like...alfalfa tea. My aunt has pain too and does not like to be without this tea.
52443,B0042GZSU0,poor communication and shipping is bad.,"seller was not honest w dealing w shipping. USPS showed shipped tracking no. but never was sent. ITEM but still not receipt to AUNTIE birthday person. She even when to the post office in her town. She personally went to the post office 2 times and talked with post master. She was told it was held up. but it is actually not even sent.so AUNTIE kept telling us that she will stay home and when she wasn't she left a cooler outside her door cuz she lives in Florida in the Keys. She was very sad. i am sad for her. I will go down to the store myself and mail it out my self, but time has passed for her actual birthday 26 April.<br /><br />The seller did not want to have any negative comments written which i agreed but the April 30 delivery did not occur. and now it is Mid May and it was not sent, so i must tell people that we are unhappy. This item was expensive as it was.then with shipping  it was more than we wanted to spend but we knew she loved loved See's candy so it was worth it."
49366,B000IHNCQO,Very Disappointing,Based on the reviews I thought I'd give the Wisconsin Cheese flavor a try.  Maybe my taste buds are getting to old.  Not much taste.  I guess I could alway use them for baiting my mouse traps.
5671,B000H23YC2,Been Lookin'!,"Forever for the perfect easy peasy gravy mix.  This is my fave!  Tastes just like the restaurant ones I love so much;  Like Bob Evans, and IHOP."
277057,B0015TMTN6,What a ripoff!,Product information states 12 x 12 ounce packages and a weight of 1.6 pounds. I received my order today of 1 x 12 ounce bag which I paid $27.50 for. I already have it packed back up. Buyer beware.
17152,B003VVL8NS,I've been lokking for this for quite a while,My cousin brought a nostalgia box of candies from our childhood to a family reunion.  The box had everything I remembered except Bonomo's Turkish Taffy.  I finally found it.  It tastes just like I remembered it.
774,B005YNDIAW,Yummy!,"I eat mustard with everything, this is hands down THE BESt mustard I have ever tried, in fact everyone I tell to try some, falls in love with it as well. Spicy, tasty, real quality.<br />If you like spicy mustard, you will love this."
329591,B002QWHJOU,Dog Teeth Cleaner,"I read the reviews and decided to purchase Greenies for my two dogs.  Unfortunately, neither one will eat them.  I gave one box to my son and one to my daughter and thier dogs love them.  Go figure."
532465,B000VTRI32,Great Dog Food,"Switched to this after two years of Science Diet. I couldn't believe that SD has by-products, so I switched and my dog loves this. I also use the regular wellness wet-food, which he devours, too."
2932,B000F9Z1WI,these ain't oreo's,"These things are low cal oreo's: minus the creme, minus the cookie! The title ""oreo"" is basically a total misnomer. These are nothing but black crackers with some sugar. If that is what you want, then click purchase."
429119,B0012KCY2Y,prices,"Whether you buy one container or a 16 pack container, the price still averages $ 1.885. Where are the bargains?"
17968,B008ZRKZSM,to $ here,"I absolutely love this stuff. I mix it with water to make peanut butter, add it to cold noodles to make Chinese cold peanut noodles, sprinkle it on ice cream and mix it in my protein drinks.  BUT I never would pay almost $8.00 for hit. My health food store sells it for $3.00.  Check out Linda's Diet Delight"
43289,B0029O0V40,Our kitten couldn't drink milk,"When we first got our kitten I thought I might have to get him another home, his off gas smelled so BAD. Found out he couldn't digest the milk I was giving him to get some fat on his bones so switched to Whiskas cat milk. His odor went away. He loves it and ask for all the time"
2867,B000PSFKE8,My Sheltie Adores Them!,"These are a great snack for any dog who has food allergies to chicken. My 20 pound Sheltie loves them more than any other chew or rawhide that we have given her. I highly recommend these for any dog, especially one with food allergies."
49598,B001E5E268,Doesn't taste like English Breakfast to me.,"I usually drink Twinnings or Bigelow English Breakfast tea in bags, but I'm trying to switch to loose teas and this was my first attempt at English Breakfast.  The dry tea smells like English Breakfast to me, but once it is brewed it smells and tastes totally different, and I don't like the taste at all.  I followed the directions and I have tried different brewing times (2-5min), adding different amounts of milk and/or sugar.  Other people might like it, but be aware that it may not taste anything like what you expect."
8680,B003VXFK44,Great balance,"I'm not a coffee snob. If I was, I doubt I'd own a Keurig. I just want a decent tasting cup of coffee with little cleanup.<br /><br />I've tried many of the flavored coffees, but they're too gimmicky for me. Starbucks brand tastes burnt to me, even their blonde roast -- in stores I mean, I have not tried the Starbucks brand kcups.<br /><br />I like this breakfast blend because it's not too dark, not too light. It tastes like what no-frills coffee should taste like. I order the biggest size to get the best value.<br /><br />Update: I just tried to create a review for the ""Jamaica Me Crazy"" coconut flavor, which I thought was terrible. (And I *love* coconut.) I should specify that the original review was for ""Breakfast in Bed."""
5010,B003BLBVOY,AWEsome drink,"I bought this drink locally and I have to tell you, they got it 'just right'. If you are like me and you like the flavor of vinegar, this drink will not disappoint, if you also like the flavor of grape. The mixture was done perfectly, No stinging taste, it's sort of mellow, yet has that flavor of vinegar you are looking for. I am highly impressed with it. I went back today and bought 5 more bottle of it at the local Co-op. Braggs is a highly regarded apple cider vinegar, so, to have that kind of base to start with means alot. I can pretty much promise you, that you will 'not' be disappointed if you buy it. They have a couple other flavors, which I will eventually try, but this one has me hooked. hehe )"
277,B000LKZK7C,Excellent!,Great service! Items arrived faster than expected. Very efficient! Will use this seller again. I highly recommend this seller! Thank you for the excellent service!
13057,B000OOT3WS,Beware PEPSIN is a pharmaceutical labeled as Candy,"This is a very dangerous product. It is not labeled as to identify ""Pepsin: A name for several enzymes secreted by the stomach to break down protein; An enzyme produced in the stomach that splits proteins into peptones; Also used as coagulant, comes from the stomach of the pigs; An enzyme from pigs' stomachs, used with rennet to make cheese."" I flushed my money down the toilet - don't be fooled by the Pure Fun Organic Candy Pepsin Swirl Mint Pinwheels - These are horrid and made me sick. I allowed a 7 year old to have one (thinking it was exactly as the package was labeled) CANDY. Stay away from Pepsin Swirl which in my opinion is fraud and the FDA needs to investigate this product."
7152,B004K30HO2,Great Item!,This is a really good product. I had a little trouble the first couple times because I didnt tighten the lid down but besides that it is a good item.
523,B000G6RYNE,Love at first bite!  Tongue-puckering tang and crunch!,"I first discovered Kettle Chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at Trader Joe's with my daughter Mindy.  I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten.  It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since.<br /><br />Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn't that poetic?<br /><br />As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches.<br /><br />I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.  Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except ""sweets,"" of course.<br /><br />My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them.  That's the reason I chose these smaller packets; I figured 24 could last me almost a month, if I was a good girl, kept my appetite under control--and hid them from the kids!  For the sake of fewer calories, I try hard and have succeeded so far.  It isn't easy, but ...<br /><br />Have I told you how much I love them?<br /><br />Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008<br />Millennium Babe: The Prophecy"
627,B000G6RYNE,Tangy and delicious snack,"For those who love salt and vinegar potato chips, this is the one to choose. The flavor is zippy and tart, with no unpleasant chemical aftertaste like the less ""natural"" versions of this snack. The 2-ounce bags are just right to share at lunch. The chips are a little greasy, and that's why I've given them 4 stars instead of 5."
32146,B0009F3SAA,Not the same anymore,"I used to love this tea. I would drink it every morning but than the stores I  would buy it from stopped selling it, so I decided to buy a case of it on amazon. I don't know what changed, but it is absolutely awful now. It has none of the flavors in it that I use to love so much... and I'll unfortunately probably never buy it again"
6825,B001LG945O,36g of sugar still there!,"If you think this is going to be a healthy product, you are sadly mistaken. It still contains 36g of sugar per can!  If you want to end up a fat diabetic, by all means, try it. Otherwise, try the ZERO CALORIE, ZERO SUGAR, ZERO CHEMICAL naturally fruit flavored seltzers like those by La Croix."
8057,B002PNGY28,LOL My cat attacks me for these!,"I have discovered the Wellness brand of cat food, and I (and my cat) adore it. I only wish it were easier to afford! Still, Amazon seems to either match PetSmart or have a better deal. (These treats, they only matched the price, but I like Amazon)<br /><br />When I open the bedside drawer that these are stored in, Ariel comes running! She would tear the bag open and eat them all if I were to accidentally leave it out! She LOVES these treats.<br /><br />I am glad that I can spoil my cat with healthy treats/food like the Wellness brand. I highly recommend these treats, although as long as they remain 4.99 you might want to first purchase from a local pet store to make sure your cat likes them."
4000,B00110FN28,Great as a baby shower party favor!,Exactly what I wanted...individual packages of cookies that I couldn't find at a store.  Shipping was only 99cents and came to be in about 3 days.<br /><br />It was great!
2246,B000ARTNR4,It's a shame to use so much corn syrup for babies!,It's a shame to use so much corn syrup for babies! I'm very disappointed when I noticed that. The same kind sold in China is even better.

171,B0064KO0BU,Worked great!,"I purchased as a giveaway for a baby shower with Jungle theme! They worked out perfect for 25 small bags of candy. I purchased 5#. If you want more than 25 small bags, I would purchase a larger bag."
86422,B000GTFL90,Peanuts,This was a gift.  I was told it arrived on time and was a quality product.
118104,B000JMBE3Q,Great product - ridiculous price!,$4.99 - when i can buy it in the local store for $2.79?? I don't think so.
4714,B00139TT72,My Happy Dog,"I switched my dog to this food and watching him truly enjoy eating and the taste of his food is worth anything.  He has eaten Precise foundation formula for the almost two years since I adopted him.  He often goes off his food and/or vomits from time to time.  I've tried switching him to Wellness and Blue Buffalo with no positive results.  I can't tell you the immediate difference in him from the first time he ate the Newman's...and he looks forward to every meal, doesn't beg for other stuff because he is satisfied, and he seems to have more energy.  He is a 110-lb Great Pyrenees and finally very happy with his food."

73351,B006WYUCV0,The BEST for sensitive stomachs,"My dog has a super sensitive stomach; no people food except the occasional schnibble of bacon or Cheerios for treats. There are probably other things, but we stopped looking bc it usually backfires, if you get my meaning.<br />He ate Royal Canin for 4 years, but unfortunately they changed the recipe and now he won't eat it.<br />I was looking for Gluten-free, but learned that it was likely the poor quality ingredients and fillers that we had to look out for.<br />I researched a lot, read reviews, read and compared ingredients by percentage,  and finally landed on Natural Choice Chicken Rice. It smells good, and is really natural.<br />We had to go cold turkey since my poor dog would dig around to avoid his old food. My vet said just do it and watch him for a few weeks,, not just a day or 2.<br />He loves Natural Choice, and never had a single reaction to the food, which isn't at all what I expected! No change is anything, even his breath is fresh.<br />I love this product, and don't mind paying a slightly higher price for much higher quality ingredients."
64645,B0042GSLPY,Lollipops are better,"These were very small and didn't hold the same bold flavor as the lollipops do, a little disappointed with the amount and the size per box. Next time I will definately order the lollipops"

51231,B000E0K7NQ,I want to love this but...,"I decided to switch from a salon brand to the damage therapy shampoo and conditioner from dove. (Previous shampoo was making my hair poof, ugh).<br /><br />The first time I used it, I thought I found a keeper. My hair felt silky smooth and looked shiny. I guess it also made my hair a little limp. But for someone with thick, wavy hair that's not a bad thing.<br /><br />My problem started a month and a half after using this. I couldn't go a full day without my hair feeling grimy and super greasy looking. Yuck! And I can't wash my hair everyday because it dries out my hair and scalp too much...On day 2, I'm afraid to be seen in public lol.<br /><br />(My hairstylist said it's from the wax they use in the conditioner to make your hair look shiny and not add volume. Although, I don't see it listed as an ingredient.)<br /> Back to the drawing board :[."

5636,B000EUJLHE,Best of the Best!!!,"Both my wife and I have been using this product for well over a year. We love it! It is one of seven or eight varieties made by this producer. Recently, each of the other flavors have been available at our local markets, but, for some reason, these markets have been unable to obtain this flavor. I was excited to find it on Amazon.com, and obtain a generous supply with no hassle, and with convenient shipping direct to my home. Comparable products don't seem to have the same flavor or consistency, and this one, mixes well with any number of cheeses and/or jellies/jams at snack time."
209252,B0025UCIXA,Full English Breakfast,"On Sunday I indulge myself with dreams of being on holiday in the UK. So I fix eggs, bacon, toast, coffee, fry some tomatoes and mushrooms, and heat up these B&M beans.<br />Perfect! Now if amazon.com would only carry English-style sausages!"
2611,B0016FY6H6,nice substitute for soda or sugary tea,"I like the taste of this product, but I have some suggestions:<br /><br />1) for strongest blueberry taste, use less than the 16 ounces of water that the instructions indicate (my first try came out like water with the merest hint of blueberry);<br /><br />2) stir REALLY well and be prepared for a bit of sediment anyway, as well as for an oddly green (I know it's green tea, but I rarely drink green things, so it seemed a bit weird to me at first); and<br /><br />3) if you're going to use a sweetener, why cancel out the health bennies by adding something like aspartame or Splenda or etc? I added a bit of agave nectar and found it perfect, but then I also like it without any sweetener at all (as long as I use less water).<br /><br />By the way, this makes hot tea as well, although it's marketed as iced tea powder.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
14419,B00063KO34,Beware of this product--one of our dogs died.,"You should monitor your dog very carefully if you give him/her these chews. One of our dogs died as a result of eating these chews, and the other three were very ill for two days. This product is very difficult for dogs to digest and can result in blocked intestines and infection. Since the package did not contain any warnings, we thought they were harmless. Be very careful if you buy these for your dog."
53153,B001E50T3S,Not the item I ordered for the second time,"I have ordered Raspberry tea, not tea raspberry flavor.  I have not opened and tried the tea with raspberry flavor, but it is not the same label as pictured on your site."
219576,B0043WOANY,Beware of expiration date...,"I'm sure this has the potential to be really good. But, here it is April of 2012 and the package I received today expired in March of 2010. I don't mind a few weeks or even months past date for a dehydrated product, but two years is kinda crazy to ship out!"
2125,B004ET9OIW,I don't know what I'd do without this...,"My 17 month old can easily eat the whole can in one day if I'd let him. He LOVES these puffs! He just munches on them like they are chocolate (or something that one really loves!). I just lay a bunch on his little table and he will just pick them up so fast and as soon as he is done he'll start whining for more. He does not do that with any other snack! It's insane! I have tried them and I must confess they are good, but can get expensive if baby gets addicted to them. I obviously buy these in bulk. We've only tried the carrot/cheese... I think the other flavor because of the green color may confuse him but I will try those as well as soon as we are done with this pack!"
8781,B00434FTDM,Pretty good chicken gumbo,"Progresso's chicken gumbo soup doesn't taste all that great when it comes out of the microwave (or off the stove, if that's your way), but it tastes pretty good. It has white meat chicken, kidney beans, okra, rice, celery, carrot, tomato, and red bell pepper in it, as you can see from the picture on the can. Check the picture I uploaded to see what the soup *actually* looks like in the bowl. The chicken was pretty firm and just right, in my bowl. The gumbo taste isn't bad. You won't feel like you're in Louisiana or Memphis while you're eating it (unless you're actually IN Louisiana or Memphis), but it has the distinctive gumbo taste and is really quite good compared to some of Progresso's other soups. My biggest complaint with this soup is that the green vegetables came out mushy, as they tend to with Progresso soups, I've found. The celery and okra were good, just very soft and mushy, which isn't really what I wanted. It did a pretty good job of filling me up, though, as they pack a whole lot into that can as always. Overall a good soup that I wouldn't mind buying more of if I see it on the shelves sometime."
1143,B002OHOC6A,My cat hates it..,"My cat will NOT eat this food. I don't know why, but it was a waste of money. I was looking for something cheap so I guess you get what you pay for."
171084,B005GTTFW4,My daughter loved these,"My daughter really only likes the food I make her but this line of pureed foods, she LOVES. Which says A LOT about the quality of these baby foods. They are as close to my pureed foods as it's going to get, in my opinion."
566,B000G6RYNE,great (hot) new flavor....,"I am a great fan of potato chips and of Thai food.  I was so happy when Kettle Chips decided to meld two of my great loves together! (What a concept.....)  These chips are spicy enough, without burning a hole in your tongue.  Also, they have a nice hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming (careful!).  Once in a while, this is a treat definitely worth indulging in."
520085,B000KOUKMY,Best Iced Tea!,"Use these tea bags in my Mr Coffee tea maker - this tea never clouds up, which is a problem I had with the Lipton tea bags."
2007,B001E5E29A,Maybe it was just my batch?,"Didnt really enjoy these after wanting to try something other than aunt jemima's from Dominicks. The pancakes tasted strange and sometimes forgettable, but it might have been due to the poor packaging they came in along with the syrup."
1961,B00473VNHK,Hard to control the quantity.,"Sea salt is more easily administered with a salt mill. This is just a salt shaker that delivers uncontrollable amounts of sea salt and anti-caking agent into your food, and no iodide. The anti-caking agent isn't event that effective, so the salt either comes out in clumps or gets stuck at the exit. Stay away!"
5150,B0031YJ38W,excellent taste and handy,These are excellent. They taste great and are just the right size.  Two can make an on the go breakfast that is tasty and good for you.  The larger size breakfast cookies are just too big. 2 of these are perfect.  My husband had gotten out of the habit of eating breakfast- too much trouble- but since I bought these he is good about grabbing one or two on the way out the door.
11778,B0012KB4WU,Cats love it,"But Fuzzy prefers the salmon primavera to the yellowfin tuna. However, Toto (aka Totolicious) loves it. I have to keep writing until I reach 20"
5996,B000I6PXLC,This is not that great,You have to put a lot of sugar in  this to make it taste good. The coffee just by itself kind if has a stinky smell like a poopy diaper or a pee pee poo poo puppy in a cup. Next time I am going for raspberry flavored coffee...cause the chocolate is like poop. YUCK.
10966,B001BIXK7K,Excellent hot sauce. A good fruity taste and great heat.,A drop at a time in a bowl (or pot) of chili will give you the heat level you want. I will save a lot of money on peppers for my chili. A little on a toothpick brought a fellow heat lover to tears.
501293,B000LKZ4W8,tastes just like caramels with sugar!,i got the variety pack and the triple threat pack.<br />loved them all...i am just reading the<br />belly fat diet book and they are recommended in<br />there as well!
10265,B003EML8PM,don't understand,This is my first time and I can't eat them they are all small hard peaces with only a frw puffie ones. Is there something wrong with my batch? I can't eat them or they would break my teeth am I doing something wrong I only cook them 1 min.

Long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder, not overly tasty, but quite effective, as I never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides.  Same for desert racing in the buggy, the camelbaks were always laced with the powder.  Now we have the Fizz...what a great product!  Firstly, its Hammer's endurolyte product so it's great, endurance athlete's the world over use their products. Second its convenient, handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz.  Third it tastes great! Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a ""salty"" taste, you get a refreshing lemon-lime or mango!  The camelbaks always get the Fizz now.  I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes. I cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough."

8172,B000E1588O,Gotta love this tea,"This tea is perfect for me. I have many food allergies and associated diet restrictions, so I cannot have regular tea and many herbal teas. This is a good tasting alternative to plain chamomile, which was previously my only option for tea. I love it! It's hard to find at stores, and was previously sold out here, so I'm glad to see it's back."
47171,B002GWHDPA,SWP or not?,"Photo on Amazon shows package with SWP for Swiss Water Processed.<br />However, when I got mine I ordered it only said Mexican Decaf Organic.<br />Was coffee beans I ordered Swiss Water Processed or not?"
3003,B0009JI7O8,Very good,Well packed. Few are broken but it is understandable. The cookies are tasty and the notes are interesting. My friends and I really enjoyed it! Thx!
1345,B000ODRY9I,Good dressing,"Like the flavor and it's thick, unlike some fat free dressings that are really runny."
53466,B001E5E0A6,"Used to be perfect, now just good","I used to love these, with my only complaint being that they were a tad on the dry side. Unfortunately, they changed the recipe last year and now they are just a little better than other cereal bars. The main changes in the ingredients list seem to be that they changed the proportions and no longer include sesame seeds. The changes seem minor, but the taste is noticably worse (I wouldn't have bothered checking the ingredients if I hadn't notice the different taste). Oh, the calorie count also went up from 110 to 130."
70785,B000E4ALGU,Slightly Disappointed - Inconsistent,My son has always loved these bars and we were getting a box about weekly from the grocery store.  I looked them up on Amazon and was excited to see that I could essentially get a box or two free by buying a case versus the individual boxes.  The problem is that many of the boxes had bars that were not the same consistancy as my son was used to and they just fell apart or had what he called syrup on them.  I am not sure if they were stored differently which caused issues or what but I was very disappointed.  I know my son threw numerous bars away when he had been begging to eat them up to this point.  I am hoping I just got a bad case but I am not sure whether to order again.  Before this experience I would have given the product 4 or 5 stars.  Based on this case maybe a 2 so I averaged it.
1600,B001CWZXIY,The best food for dogs!,"In my opinion, this is the best food for dogs.  My boyfriend is an avid researcher, and he concluded this is the bet food for dogs on all accounts - taste (the dogs love it), health-wise (it has healthy fats, and the first and main ingredient is meat as opposed to ingredients such as corn) and digestion-wise (the dogs get diarrhea when they eat human food or any other dog food).  We have two dogs we adopted from a shelter, and while at first, one of our dogs would not eat the food (he had worms though, so who knows what junk he was eating before), he soon began to understand that is what we were going to feed him and very soon, he came to love it.  Now they jump when it's dinner time!  Our dogs are happy, very healthy, have shiny coats, and a large part of this is due to this fantastic dog food.  We get it on Subscribe and Save and we usually go through 1 bag p/ month - for reference, we have one 15lb Bichon and one Alaskan husky."
8795,B000M5PP8U,Delicious and Easy,"This steak rub is spectacular. I rub it liberally on steak (usually NY strip), let is sit for a while and then grill.  It has been getting rave reviews and we are already on our 3rd jar. I wish they would sell it in bigger jars. Amazon's price is a bit high though."
75576,B0025WGHEE,"Good product, but too expensive on Amazon","Gatorade made from the powder mix doesn't taste syrupy like store-bought Gatorade does.  It's also much less expensive to mix your own -- think about it, why would you pay for a bottle of water + flavor syrup?  HOWEVER, the prices for this product on Amazon and eBay are very inflated.  I found it at my local grocery store (HEB) for about $7, which was on sale from about $8.  The online prices are ridiculous."
5101,B004157PZI,The Best Beef Jerky Ever!,"Well, after trying a lot of brands, this is probably the best beef jerky I ever tasted!"
6277,B000KOSDY6,I Love it Too!!!,I too am so glad Amazon sells this!!  I sometimes add a 1/4 cup of sugar when I want it sweeter:)
45042,B0029NTQ1K,Why can't I buy these in Canada!?,"I bought these when I was in the States (I live in Canada), and now my cat has a monkey on his back...and I can't buy them here! :(  And not only can I not buy them in Canada, I can't even order them on Amazon for reasons I don't fully understand. What am I going to do? His Royal Majesty (I mean the cat, of course) MUST have his Catnip Temptations! He's addicted. I can't drive down there in the winter when the roads are bad (like right now). He doesn't forget about them. It doesn't matter if I hide them. He knows. He watches me. He watches everyone who he thinks might give him his treats. I'm down to the last bag. I need...I need a Catnip Temptations dealer. Or I need to send him to Catnip Temptations Rehab."
209239,B002VROXD0,not an orginal product!!!,I racived this product and its no orginal!!!<br />don't buy this product.<br />it doesnt look the like the orginal and my dog didnt want to eat it
216308,B001LNLW5M,decaf drink,Thank god there is something for people with acid reflux! This is my morning coffee
55476,B004F9QADS,Poorly shipped,The adapter was missing and one of the holders to the pot was missing and the package was ripped and poorly packaged and shipped. I returned it and was refunded.
119858,B0009YUEG2,works for our two cats,"we have two cats and they share a litter box that we've been filling with Feline Pine for about a year. I only gave it four stars because it's a bit pricey in my opinion, but otherwise we like it a lot."
231347,B003FDC2I2,Meal Replacement drink,"It's not terrible; but it's not great either although it satisfies my chocolate cravings.  Just a side note, it is MUCH better really cold and poured into glass to drink out of."
37789,B000LKVDO6,I've had better,"I bought a bunch of the Kitchens of India items during a promotional sale and the only one I'd recommend is the butter chicken sauce.  If they were tasty I could overlook the salt content for the occasional enjoyment but I'm not loving the taste.  I ofter buy similar products from Trader Joes and those, in my opinion, are much better and cost far less."
81634,B00176DXW8,"Dogs love em, owner hates em",My dogs love the flavor of these things and they can spend hours chewing on them.  The problem is they are SO MESSY.  They are covered in chicken that flakes off all over the place.  I like the concept of chicken covered rawhide but I need to find ones that don't require a vacuum!!
319613,B000FNEX8C,Hungry for chocolate,This cookie has no chocolate flavor.  The texture is gritty and crumbly.<br />I would not buy them again.
5613,B000G1X45G,This coffee smells like farts,"I have never tasted this coffee.  But when people brew it in my house, it makes my house smell like farts.  It might taste really good, but I can't get over the fart smell.  You've been warned."
532289,B006G67A1Y,coffee,product was well packaged and the variety of flavors are wonderful.the downfall of this was all the d-caf coffee that came with it.  I Think you should separate REG\D-CAF accordingly..
59261,B003AYYXWO,Cuppa review,"London Cuppa Tea 440 bags is a good everyday black tea. The only thing I would like to see different is the packing which would be on the freshness if the tea bags are vacuum packed. Also if the tea bags are arranged or grouped like those in the box versions, they would be less messy every time the bag is opened."
273380,B001EQ5FEU,Fantastic,I buy this Tea for my British Mother-In-Law.  She loves it.  World Market never seems to have it in stock.  I order it online and treated like a king!
49341,B000IHNCQO,Terrible,"There are few foods I don't like, but I couldn't get these down. I can't begin to describe how terrible they taste and how unappetizing the texture is. Unfortunately, I bought them in several flavors and each one I opened was worse than the one before. I begged my co-workers to take them off my hands but no one would eat them. I even offered five bucks to whoever would eat a bag of them and no one could do it -- and I work in an office of cheapskakes who never met free food they didn't like. Don't buy these.<br /><br />If you want a no-carb crispy cheese snack put a thin layer of shredded cheese on a plate and microwave it for roughly 2 minutes. Keep checking so you don't burn it but let bubble up and get crispy. Much much much much much better than these nasty freaky cheese thingies."
66485,B000H27O7I,So good!,"I never get tired of mint chocolate cocoa! Can be pricey, try to catch when on sale or shop around Amazon's vendors for the lowest price. Quick turnaround when ordering, never been disappointed and I order ALOT!"
530117,B002BGFHTK,GreatTea,"My wife loves this tea.  Can't find it in the stores on Maui, so I order it on-line from Amazon.  We order the 6 box case."
67641,B007OXJK3Y,Weak Coffee with Lestoil!,"This is the absolute worst flavored coffee I ever put in my mouth.  I took several sips to be sure I hated it.  On the fourth sip I had to spew it back into the cup.  I thought possible the shipment was tainted with chemicals.  Please don't buy a large quantity that you'll have to pawn off on someone.  For those who like it, enjoy."
4237,B004391DK0,Just like the real thing!!!,"It was worth the wait--Gluten Free Bisquick is just like the real thing!! Everything tastes the way you remember it. So make dumplings, pancakes or cheddar biscuits they are all as good as they can be!"
468101,B003KFCY06,Yuck,"I'm sticking with what used to be carnation, now nestles malt. this stuff tastes like powdered milk with a hint of soy."
2661,B0016FY6H6,Love it!,I drink this delicious tea almost every day.  I have yet to find anything like it on the market.
42763,B002NHYQAS,Dark Chocolate for Milk Chocolate Luvers,"This chocolate, unlike many dark chocolates I've tried, has more the sweetness and smoothness of milk chocolate. There is very little bitterness. The cocoa level is 54 percent, and is organic, making it a less guilty indulgence.<br /><br />This chocolate goes well with Pinot Noir!"
5329,B000BYLQW6,Choco Drops,"A superior dog treat with a chocolate flavor. These drops are not toxic to dogs and are vitamin enriched. My dogs just love them.  My grandchildren ate few thinking they were ""Hershey kisses""!! The children's mother who is a Pharmacist stated that the drops were not toxic to children or dogs!! The  product is excellent,service from the Amazon supplier was excellent but I wish they (any supplier) would not use UPS as a shipper. UPS is slower than ""Snail Mail""!!"
554117,B000R8YIFI,"They sent regular tomatoes, NOT San Marzano","I ordered a case of these tomatoes and when they arrived, I noticed that the can didn't say ""San Marzano"" like the picture showed and the advertisement said.  I contacted Amazon and they said they would send another case of the correct tomatoes.  Well, I got another case of the same regular tomatoes.  Either Amazon is cheating their customers or the company they are contracting with are cheating Amazon customers.  What bothered me the most is that Amazon didn't seem to care that I was sent the wrong product twice."
210406,B001TM70V0,My buddies love this stuff,This stuff is the only grain-free canned cat food that all four of my furry buddies agree on!
3424,B005K4Q1VI,Best Hot Cocoa for Keurig,As you know finding a hot chocolate that taste great and is brewed on the keurig is a big challenge. Well this hot chocolate is quite good. The flavor is rich and the hot chocolate has some creaminess to it. I made it for my daughter and toped it off with whipped cream and she loved it.  Will be drinking lots of this on now that it is begining to get colder.
44473,B000R7XFDK,short life,There wasn't a very long time before the expiration date was due. That info should be known when a food product is sold at Amazon.
435400,B0051ONT62,Not worth the price.,I did not realize that this was the price for ONE bottle.  That's my fault.  As a result I wouldn't purchase it again.
1052,B001TZSDJK,Totally Fantastic,"This is the first time I've used the coconut oil from Manila Coco Factory and I was so pleased with the taste, smell and overall incredible quality that I will buy more and recommend it to my family and friends.  I am so glad I tried it. I have been using coconut oil for several years and it has changed my life and health.  This oil ranks high in my book. Also, I liked ordering this product through amazon because they make it fast, easy and painless. Thank you for having this product on your site Amazon."
50302,B000FBQ50I,bal,"Bahlsen Delice Cookies, 3.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)<br />Very Disappointed with your service and deceptive listing of the product ingredients. i am allergic eggs and as per your listing, there is NO mention of eggs and when i received the product, on the box the cookies one of the ingredient is EGG."
855,B0007NG568,Loved the Oats!!,"Good quality oats. Package came on time. Oats worked well in recipes. I will admit, as a single person I bought these oats with my boyfriend for breakfast food- it lasted us for the year.<br /><br />Otherwise it's an excellent buy."
383366,B00423UVBO,"My dog says, ""I can't eat just one!""","I was looking for an irresistible (to my dog) training treat, and this is it! I like the fact that each piece is tiny, so I'm not worried about over-feeding."
6164,B002GURBZ4,wonderful,"I need every color that is available ! Love this product! ! Received shipment very fast! Very happy with this product, will buy more."
4622,B002ESSP7G,Good Chocolate taste.,I got this at a local discount store for $6. It has an excellent flavor and the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead if 5 was personal preference.
7285,B0014C3QTU,quick glucose boost with no sticky pockets!,"This packaging is awesome - my main annoyance with regular Jolly Ranchers is that if you keep them in your pocket, they will melt and stick to the wrapper and eventually stick to your pocket. Not delicious. This packaging completely fixes all that - it's the size of a pack of gum, and the candies don't stick to anything!<br /><br />Clearly not the healthiest thing to eat, but if you're on your feet all day long and often find yourself without a meal for 8+hours, these could be a convenient quick fix for when you start to feel all weird and wobbly and hypoglycemic.<br /><br />Totally no nutrition in these, but they are GREAT for when you need a bit of glucose boost."
5523,B001EQ5DHE,Convenient Way to Get Kool-Aid,My local Harris Teeter stopped carrying and said they could not get this product any more.  So happy to find it on Amazon.com!!
434451,B0037YXQSY,"Yummy, but you might find a better price...","Definitely a 5 star product, but we get it at Costco in a 30-pack for about $10. If you have Costco in your area, you might want to check it out. (Update: The Costco pack is all Milk Chocolate, BTW--thanks for comment pointing that out. Also, it's only about $8 as of 3/2012.)"
70986,B005XB5WEU,Cheaper at Sam's,"If anyone has a membership to Sam's Club, they have this type of SB coffee, same count box for $38.  Just a head's up."
554216,B00333C7VQ,Product arrived damaged,Product was not packaged well and arrived damaged and was not usable. Would not purchase this product again in the future.
1632,B001RVFDOO,Don't Defeat the Purpose by Eating Two Bags at Once!,"I have to watch my calories, but I tend to not be very successful if the food I eat is tasteless.  I have enjoyed all six flavors of these Popchips and feel great eating them at 100 calories per bag.  My favorites are Sour Cream & Onion and the Sea Salt and Vinegar flavors.  In fact, they're so good I just want to keep eating them; and have to resist opening a second bag, because that really defeats the purpose!  I like the variety pack and it's not a bad value."
1847,B001RVFDOO,"Tasty, Crunchy, and Filling","I won't get into all of the specifics of these chips as they are listed here on Amazon. However, I will talk about the product overall. It is very well packaged, the PopChips bags aren't flimsy or too loud. You don't have to worry much about these getting smashed while they're in a bag with heavier items. They hold their own. When trying new foods, snacks, flavors, I tend to purchase a variety pack so that I can sample everything. Let me tell you, these chips are packed with flavor but, it's not, in my opinion, too heavy or saturated. My favorites are the Barbecue Potato and Cheddar Potato by far. Very realistic, savory flavors. Then, there a couple that are not my favorite but, tasty with time. The Sea Salt and Pepper Potato and the Sea Salt and Vinegar Potato are a bit strong at first and, if you don't like those flavors, I would say you wouldn't like those chips but, they certainly accomplish the taste of those ingredients. Original Potato and Sour Cream and Onion Potato are also tasty but, nothing to necessarily rave about, for me at least. I would not call this a ""diet"" chip but, a healthy alternative to over processed chips. I saw a few complaints about the PopChips being ""too salty"" or ""high in sodium"". The chips can come across salty to a person who doesn't consume much salt but, per bag, these PopChips contain about as much sodium as a cup of plain yogurt. Overall, great buy. You just have to decide if the price tag is okay for you, and for me, it is."
22242,B000KV61FC,$10 thrown away,"My dog destroyed the rubber ""cord"" in 5 minutes (worse yet, swallowed it), got very nervous trying to get the treats out and almost attacked my other dog for trying to get it from her (which she never before did). I had to take her toy away and wish i could get my money back. $10 is not a cheap tog toy, so it could be at least durable. I bought it because i thought it'd be a good distraction to keep her entertained and less anxious when i leave, but now i'm afraid it'd be inducing aggression and causing harm if ingested. And that would cost much more... Better stick to Kong toys, the only ones so far my chewing dog cannot destroy it!"
420,B004X8TK8I,These are Famous for a reason.,These arrived on time and packaged in green plastic wrap.  The cookies were as fresh as the boxes found in the local grocery store.<br /><br />I have no complaints but I also now have no more cookies. We ate them all!
8277,B000VK6NDC,as long as he likes it...,"i'm giving this a solid 5, because my old but healthy cat loves this stuff and it's wicked good for him, but i'll tell you right now that this stuff looks and smells quite gross; as long as i don't have to eat it, it's all good."
55707,B00141QYMC,They LOVE them!!!!,"I have three little furballs and they LOVE these... They turn up their noses at a lot of treats, but not this one.  I just ordered the sweet potato and chicken treats,  I hope they like those too!!"
110217,B001PMC3O8,My fat cats love it,My 2 fat cats can not get enough of this canned food. They eat it like it is going out of style.
3040,B0052OI128,These are good but..........................,"these are grossly overpriced.  It is a package of three boxes but when you take into account that they are a dollar of two per box than they should be, you then have to pay for shipping.  Sorry, I would skip them.  My local grocery store carries them and a box is anywhere from 2.98 to 3.49 each.  Although these are healthier than some other cookies, you still have to watch the fat, sugar and salt contents.  Whole foods are much better for you but in a moment or two of indulging, these fit the bill.  Just the price on this site is ridiculous!  Ask your grocer to start carrying them."
8879,B001EQ5EQE,A solid Decaf,"I would prefer to drink the regular Lavazza all the time,  but when I cannot handle the caffeine I use this.  It is a very good coffee."
159463,B003OP8NZC,Not as advertised,"Ordered as a gift for my parents, it was not as advertised.  The coated peanuts were spicy and not advertised as such.  Also the chocolate covered cherries were in fact cherry candies like an M&M. I will not order from this distributor again.  It did arrive promptly but I credit Amazon for that."
44972,B0029NTQ1K,Whiskas Temptations - Cat Treats,Cat treats?  My MinPin (Dog) goes crazy over these!  I've been giving him these little treats for a couple of years along with his dog food...but I think he would give up his dog food for these!! It all started out as an accident..I didn't read the print saying they were for cats.
550841,B005BSPOHU,beware DO NOT WORK WITH SENSEO,I bought these for use in my Senseo machine ...they DO NOT WORK !!! tHE COFFEE was like water. If you have a Senseo machine do not buy these.
5296,B002TMTP12,3000 != 850,"The fact that the title of this product includes the number 3000 is misleading.  I'm not even sure what that number refers to.  I can tell you that it does not refer to the quantity of gumballs in the package (which is 850).  It's true that the product details stated the actual quantity of 850, but apparently I glossed over that fact.  The price is still a good deal compared to other vendors on Amazon; just not quite as good as I had originally thought.  Shipping took a week longer than expected, but I did receive and apology email.  The gumballs themselves were well packaged.<br />I would buy from this vendor again (assuming that the consumption of 850 gumballs does not kill me)."
1266,B003O7A70Y,Makes excellent biryani,"I actually use this mix to make vegetable biryani and it works well for this purpose,  with some slight adjustments to the recipe.<br /><br />I do have one caveat about the product, but it's about the recipe given, not the spice mix. I think the amount of ghee it is suggested you use (200 grams) is too much, and you can easily use 100 grams instead. Also, I think it's easier to mix the spices and yogurts first and cover the chicken (or vegetables) with the mix to marinate than to mix it in the pan while frying.<br /><br />To make vegan biryani you can substitute vegetables for chicken, coconut milk for yogurt, and safflower or peanut oil for ghee.<br /><br />Overall this spice mix makes the tastiest biryani I've had outside of a restaurant, and even rivals some of them. And the price makes this an incredible deal--there are 2 bags per package and there are 6 packages, so this makes 12 large batches for ~$13 with free shipping. I will definitely order more when I run out."
6441,B002OLK5JO,Heartier And Better Than I Expected,"This soup is like a combination of vegetable, lentil and Spanish rice soups.  It has a slightly gelid texture, though I never add as much water as I should.  4.5 stars to be exact."
12974,B002SW9J8W,Great if you like your chocolate with a side of body lotion,"I bought this candy on a whim because I love pretty much all things coconut. I figured it would taste like a m&m's version of an almond joy minus the almonds, but was much disappointed. It tasted like an overly sweet waxy coconut body lotion, with a hint of chocolate and candy shell. UTTERLY DISGUSTING. Too late, i noticed on the ingredients list there was no coconut at all to be found--it's all artificial flavoring.<br />I had to throw the bag away."
4611,B00584HTX4,cute packaging if you put it all together,"I bought these and yes they do come in plastic bags with a label on each but also included was a five sided box that you can fold together that has a picture of each flavor, one on each side. It makes a cute little colorful box, nice to give as a gift if you put it together."
4424,B000E5AO8O,My Favorite Candy But-o-Honey,I found the candy to be harder than I had expected.  It came in bar form and it is rather hard to chew but just as tasty--just takes more chewing to enjoy!!
2288,B005QSIQKC,Top quality Salsa,Had this sent to me in Afghanistan. The flavor was enjoyable but not to spicy. It is made with quailty ingridents. I would surely say this is one of the best salsa's I've ever had.
514817,B000CSEFQ0,The one box that we all like,This is the only box of cereal that has choices for all 6 of us. Don't forget to recycle the plastic bowls!

3364,B005K4Q1VI,"Great Deal, Great Cocoa!","Got a brand new Keurig machine for Christmas and immediately went to work finding the cheapest and best tasting K-Cups on the market. I came across this when searching for some good Hot Cocoa and am amazed at how many K-Cups you really get out of this. 48 K-Cups for about $20 when I purchased was a great deal when most Hot Chocolate prices were 16 K-Cups for $15~$19.<br /><br />This is a great deal and you get to try out Peppermint, Dark Chocolate and Milk Chocolate. It's light on calories and most important of all taste GREAT!<br /><br />Must have if your a Hot Chocolate lover or have family that wants a easy to make, great tasting Hot Chocolate for less!"
70112,B007I7Z3Z0,Could be OK if not for the artificial sweetener and flavors,"The product's name lead me to believe it would be naturally flavored with flavors I like.  Unfortunately, the flavor of the artificial sweetener is very pronounced and it is a flavor I strongly dislike.  I do not use artificial sweeteners and avoid artificially sweetened beverages because I do not like the flavor, not for health reasons.<br /><br />I used one packet per 24 oz bottle of water and I am sure that if I were to mix it per instructions it would be way too sweet.  I was not able to taste honey or pomegranate.  Blackberry is somewhat pronounced, although not as a natural but as an artificial blackberry flavor.<br /><br />I also had a problem with packaging.  When I tore the corner of a packet at notch, the resulting hole was too small for the contents to pour out.  I had to jiggle the packet and push the contents out.  That created a cloud of fine dust which I inhaled - not pleasant.  I struggled with the second packet as well.  It is possible that it is just the batch I received that did not have the tear notch punched properly.<br /><br />The description says ""Sweetened with honey, made from real tea leaves and real fruit flavors."" I am surprised this kind of marketing is allowed or tolerated.  It is just as much (probably more if you consider contribution to the total sweetness) sweetened with artificial sweeteners as it is with honey.  As for the green tea or pomegranate flavor...  Who can tell that this tastes anything like either one of those things?  It seems like a manufacturer can show to a cousin of a random employee a picture of tea leaves and pomegranates and let them listen to bees buzzing and then claim that the product was made with tea leaves, honey, and real pomegranate flavor.<br /><br />I would not buy this product the way it currently is."
115376,B0009YGCXQ,Not Received in a Timely Manner,Ordered through Amazon who had to order it through another company who did not send in a timely manner to be reached by the receiver by Christmas.<br /><br />I will not order things like this again.

2078,B001E5E29A,"good, reliable results, expensive","I bought the mix at the same time as the Oster 3874 waffle maker and have been pleased with the results: light, well baked waffles that tasted good.  My problems with the mix were first the expense, secondly that the mix is very finely ground and flies around when poured and there may some sort of perfume added to it.  It simply smells too good.<br /><br />I am happy with the product but will probably not reorder it."
16362,B007TJGZ54,Way too weak and watery!,"I don't like strong coffee but this is so weak and watery, it's like drinking...something other than coffee. I tried brewing a small size, using a different size cup, adjusting my cream and sugar, nothing works! It's really disappointing because I've had other good blends from Green Mountain in the past. I'll stick with Wolfgang Puck's Rodeo Drive or Breakfast In Bed."

5914,B001DIM8K8,Simple RECIPE,"Perhaps some of you are like I was... wanting to take advantage of the health benefits of oatmeal, but uncertain how to prepare it so that you and your family will actually eat it. After experimenting a bit, and reading lots of recipes, I've come up with a simple, yet tasty way to prepare McCANN's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal. Give it a try, and you may decide that oatmeal can be a healthy and delicious addition to your breakfast menu.<br /><br />Recipe:<br /><br />- Start by bringing 3 cups of water to a boil (about 3 minutes in the microwave).<br />- In a medium saucepot, melt 1 tablespoon of butter then add 1 cup of oats. Toast the oats on medium heat for about 3 minutes.<br />- Add the boiling water to the toasted oats and simmer for 25 minutes. Don't stir. It should get to a soft bubbling simmer.<br />If it boils to hard, you stove is set too hot, so turn it down or it will burn.<br />- Add 1 cup of milk (or can do with a mix of milk and buttermilk).<br />- Cook an additional 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.<br /><br />Makes 4-5 good size servings with excellent texture and consistency. It thickens once it sits a little bit. You can increase or decrease the milk to adjust the consistency as desired. You can also save it for up to a week in the refrigerator without much difference in taste. Just store in small sealed bowls. Each can of McCANNs oatmeal makes about 16-20 servings.<br /><br />Everyone likes to top and sweeten their oatmeal differently (sugar, brown sugar, maple syrup, raisins, etc.). Only add the toppings when you're ready to eat it, not before storing in the refrigerator. For my serving, I like to add 2 tsp of brown sugar, a sprinkle of cinnamon, about 1/2 tbsp of butter, and then top with chopped pecans. Very tasty. Hope you enjoy!<br /><br />Please be kind enough to indicate if reviews are helpful."
36312,B00014H710,didn't get what i asked for,"the one i got says ""cleanse"" on the box, I don't know what it means, but I know that I picked the one that doesn't say ""cleanse"" on the box. i'm all the more angry because that one costs way cheaper. and all the more am i angry because i'm not going to bother to go through the refund process. plus it took it ages to arrive"
6581,B002BRC562,YUMMY!,"These are tbe best fruit chews I've ever had!  The flavor and texture is great.  My son had these last summer for the first time when he was at the Boy Scout Ranch, Philmont, in New Mexico.  He, of course, said this as a real treat while he was there.  I'm so glad I found them on Amazon!  Well worth the price...a great value!"
75904,B001CPOR2E,"Made In America, with a STRING going through them","I bought these because they are made in America and my dogs are worth it.  What I don't like about them is that there is a thick string, or maybe just a thick vain of some kind, going through each piece. A much smaller issues is that these are very hard, even hard to break by hand.  We have been using a pliers to break the pieces up before serving and then a scissors to cut the string part!  A dog could choke to death with these.<br /><br />My biggest problem is that I am looking for an alternative USA raised chicken solution for treats."
56653,B0012XBD7I,The bags were damaged with holes and stains.,"The chips were great...for the first few bags. However, after the first bag or two, I noticed that the remaining bags were damaged. There were holes in each bag and black, sticky stains on the outside. Other reviewers who bought around the same time that I did are now claiming that they found rodent holes in their bags of chips.<br /><br />The chips came in a sealed Kettle box, so it's hard to say who screwed up. But someone somewhere screwed up. These chips were a health hazard before the holes in the bag. Now? It's like a game of roulette."
1714,B001RVFDOO,Great Snack!!,MY kids loved these and they were such a great deal. I didn't feel so guilty about giving my kids chips!!
9361,B006N3IG4K,Great find!,"Love this coffee! The aroma is as delicious as the flavor. My husband would typically have a cup of coffee once or twice a month, now he's having a cup several times a week."
5002,B00653KJ5M,perfect for sweet tooth just coming off gluten,i just started the paleo diet and i love it! lost 4 lbs in like a week! anyway i was so glad to find out there are paleo cookies out there and thank goddess they're good!! i loved the original and when they sent me them i got a sample of tropical and i loved that too! so i ordered the tropical and got a sample of rainforest! at first they're good but if you read the ingredients u'll see there is cayenne pepper in it and im really sensitive to hot spices and i could SOOO feel it on my tong! it was like an after taste. but if u enjoy a little fire with ur sweet u'll like rainforest flavor! really wanna try the alpine flavored ones they're a lot darker in color so it should be interesting :) good job caveman bakery! I LOVE YOU!
71513,B000LKZ9WS,Taste like paste,"Granted, I tried to doctor this mix up based upon some other reviews and my own baking experience pre-gluten-free, but I imagine if these muffins tasted as bad as they did doctored up, this is a pretty sorry mix.  It is possible that I just got a bad bag, but the expiration date was still 11 months away so no excuse.  I added orange juice and yogurt in place of water for moisture, and added 1/3C brown sugar as a sweetener.  I threw in a large dash of flax seed meal (which I add to everything I bake GF for fiber and protein).  I added butter (whirred with the brown sugar to start) in place of oil, and 1C frozen blueberries since the goal was blueberry muffins.  They were awful enough, literally like paste, that I had to spit out what I ate and so did my husband.  But the kids had fun making them and actually like them.  Good thing I made banana bread muffins from scratch the same day or I would have been really disappointed."
9976,B001CGTN1I,"Great price, well packaged","These may last forever at 1T every day in my morning shake since I'm having trouble finding recipes for other ways to use these seeds, but they will keep (in a sealed plastic container)."
69506,B000EDBQ4M,"Ewwww! Low on chocolate, high in bland/bean flavor","I love the Betty Crocker chocolate chip cookie mix, but I can't have it anymore due to the milk in it. I also tend to like Bob's Red Mill products. I was excited to see this was a mix I could have. Despite other reviewer's advice to not try the dough, I did. It tastes just like a bean. I decided to add some vanilla and a little brown sugar. I tried the dough again, EW! Still awful. Unfortunately I was out of my allergy-friendly chocolate chips because this mix desperately needed some more chocolate chips! I cooked them hoping the flavor would improve. Taking other reviewer's advice, I cooked them a little long because the reviews said that is what makes the bean flavor go away. (Why not just use beans to begin with Bob's Red Mill??) I just ate a warm cookie, and while it wasn't so ""beany"" anymore, it wasn't good. They are very bland."
9226,B006N3IG4K,Excellent Brew,"I like the darker roast coffees and this fits the bill.  This is every bit as good as Deidrich and Tulley's but typically costs more.  I guess Wolkgang wants a cut.  If you catch it on sale, buy it."
75002,B0026RQTGE,Dogs love it,"I'm not sure this helps the tarter since my dogs need their teeth cleaned every other year but I can tell you they really love this stuff.  It does seem to help their breath, probably by settling their stomachs, and they never had a bad reaction to this treat."
355775,B002QWP8H0,Do these things work,We started giving these to our dog to avoid having to have her teeth cleaned at a cost of 4 times human cleaning.  We'll see if it worked on our next vet appointment.

72660,B004X3VRLG,My dog absolutely loves these,"I have no idea how well these help with my dog's digestion, but I know this: My Jack Russell Terrier absolutely loves these treats. There are only 7 in a bag, but it takes her about half an hour to destroy one of these - and she chews it until it is gone so there are no leftover bits like she leaves behind when she chews a rawhide."
35521,B001P76XAS,disappointed,"I went to the store and noticed that Pop Secret changed the package size in the 6 Pack Homestyle from 3.5 to 3.2 ounces.  Then they say you get more than Orville Redenbocker to try to justify the shrinking package.  So, instead of getting 3.5 ounces as you did before, you're now getting 3.2 ounces and it takes less time to cook.  I don't think this is right, I'm going to have to start shopping around even though I like this popcorn.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P7531S"">Pop Secret Homestyle Popcorn, Microwavable Popcorn, 3-Count, 10.5-Ounce Box (Pack of 6)</a>"

21872,B000KV61FC,Great Way to Entertain Your Dog,"Our Jack Russell is a real chow hound and just `wolves' down her food.  We now serve Wendy all her dinners in the Tug-a-Jug.  At first she was quite frustrated but we mixed some small kibble with the regular size and she was rewarded enough to keep working on it.  Now we simply toss in a couple handfuls of kibble screw the top back on and dinner lasts 15-20 minutes instead of the 2 minute bowl feast.  Some reviewers didn't like the plastic rope in this newer version, but I find it cleans up easier and does not become frayed."

These Tootsie Pops are for my hubby anyway; he takes them along for long car trips. I couldn't count them without having at least one.  yum...I love Tootsie Pops<br /><br />Tootsie Pops have a Tootsie Roll center (a chewy, chocolate candy that doesn't melt) surrounded by a hard candy sucker/lollipop.<br /><br />One Tootsie Pop has 60 calories, 10 grams of sugar, 15g total carbohydrate & 2% of the daily iron requirement; no fat, cholesterol, fiber or sodium.<br /><br />~~UPDATE: We just received our 2nd order of Tootsie Pops.

Well, our third shipment arrived today & instead of rec'g the Variety Pack (which doesn't really mention 'variety pack' on the box, but instead says Assorted) we rec'd the Fun Flavor Assortment. So I did a count:<br /><br />52 Cherry; 13 Chocolate; 12 Strawberry; 10 Lemon Lime; 9 Blue Raspberry; 8 Watermelon =  104 Tootsie Pops<br /><br />These 3 shipments each came from different suppliers.  Two were fulfilled by Amazon."

4636,B000FFRY3G,Not like regular English Muffins,"These english muffins are okay at best.  They are very hard to cut and break apart easily making it hard to toast.  They definitely have to have something like jelly or peanut butter spread on them otherwise, do not taste the best."

62547,B000EMQFZI,This is the real thing,"I have been fooled in the past by packages that sell the ""snack"" size so I had to look hard at the photo to confirm that the bags are the normal 3.2 OZ size. I am writing this review so YOU don't have to squint."

356196,B0018RYBZ4,I love Dreamfields pasta,I always use Dreamfields pasta whenever I make a pasta meal..It tastes just like regular pasta because it doesn't give my sugar a spike.
5293,B004K051VE,Simply perfect!,"Childhood nostagia all over again! I LOVE peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but I don't often make them because they're rather messy. These bars solve that problem-- the oats and stuff provide a perfect compliment to the peanut butter and jelly flavor that's in the bar. The best part is that I can eat this on the go and not have to worry about my hands or clothes getting messed up."
50375,B000EFFTNO,Not Bad,"It's not too bad considering it's microwaveable rice, but the product is a tad too watery for my taste. It's more of a stew than a bowl of rice. I would recommend buying one bowl at the grocery store before buying this box of twelve. All in all the product isn't bad, and it's a great deal."
57573,B004UHL0IA,Disgusting...,I agree with the other reviewer. I bought this from a local store because I could not wait to try it....the flavor sounded so good. What a letdown!!! I was choking after the first sip from the completely awful taste! Don't waste your money like I did.
109,B001REEG6C,Asparagus Bliss,"I love asparagus.  Up until very recently, I had never had pickled asparagus.  Oh my goodness, when a friend introduced me to this exact brand, I couldn't believe how great stuff tasted.  I loved it so much I bought the six pack.  I've got 2 jars left.  Gonna need more!!"
9261,B006N3IG4K,Above average K-cup coffee,"We have a Keurig coffee maker. One of the side benefits is the opportunity to experiment with different K-cups. I have already tried half a score. Some seem pretty tasty at first--until one taste something that is even better. Some early K-cups that I graded highly don't compare too well with later brands that I have tried.<br /><br />Wolfgang Puck's Columbian Dark Roast Noir is one of the better products that I have tried. It has a bold taste, although not strongly so. It is also smooth tasting.<br /><br />It is now on my short list of possibilities for my first morning cup of coffee. So, I am pretty happy with Wolfgang Puck's product here."

47092,B000H27NY2,too expensive,"While I love their soups, this is a crazy high price for these soups.  Every grocery store around us is selling these soups for 2.99 each and we live in a rural area of northern Minnesota and have access to about 4 grocery stores, both large and small.  When you do the math on this product, it comes out to $4.78 each.  That is way higher than what I can pay for at a store.  Very disappointed in Amazon's pricing for this product!"

67267,B004JRXZKM,My honest opinion,"This product is awful.  When I took a bite, they were slippery and slimy and there isn't any sauce or seasoning that will get me past that awful consistency.  I rushed to the trash can and spit them out, then dumped the rest, including the five unopened packages. These aren't noodles, they are stringy, stretchy globs of gelatin.  If you must try them for yourself, get a couple of friends to share a minimum shipment and save yourself some money."
63293,B00014D6YW,Good For Mild Detox,"The taste of this tea will take some getting used to - it's a bit peppery and warm, and you can taste a tiny bit of licorice in it. Sounds disgusting, I know, but it isn't bad - just...odd. I've heard that it helps with recovery from colds and mild illnesses, though I haven't tried it for that purpose myself. As for the ""detox"" effects, they're extremely mild and you likely won't notice any physical difference (except for increased energy, perhaps)."

54695,B0098C6B36,It's Terrible.,"Do you remember what it smells like to add water to an ashtray full of cigarettes? That's how this coffee tastes. I added a caramel, some hazelnut flavoring, a packet of hot chocolate with miniature marshmellows, and Coffeemate vanilla chai creamer too it. It still tasted bitter, like wet cigarettes and metallic. I think the metallic flavor comes from the t-disc packaging. It doesn't make sense to buy a $100 coffee maker and drink trashy coffee. Especially when you can take that same amount of cash and buy some good coffee. I ignored the bad ratings of other reviewers because I believed the positive reviews. The only redeeming factors are that it is cheaper (less than $7 at Walmart), and that you can make a single cup of coffee. If it were allowed, I'd give it a -5 rating (or &lt;-> -,  for infinitly horrible)."

I would not normally purchase this type of product, so my review and opinion will be biased in that regard.<br /><br />I'm not a big soda drinker, I'd just rather drink water or coffee. I will occasionally drink a diet soft drink, usually Diet Pepsi or Diet Coke.<br /><br />Did you know that a single 12oz can of Coke Classic® has 140 calories and 39 grams of sugar? This 8oz can of Switch has 140 calories and 34grams of sugar. And this is healthy? 4 ounces less is size, same caloric content and more sugar per ounce that Classic Coke. OK, so it's not ""added"" sugar, but still, that's a lot of sugar. 100% Orange juice, 8 oz, has 120 calories and 28 grams of sugar.<br /><br />The can says it is ""Orange Tangerine"" but in fact the contents are #1: Water #2: Concentrates of Apple, Grape, Tangerine, Orange, and Acerola juices. Then they throw in some ""gum acacia"", ""natural flavors and colors"" and some ""ascorbic acid(vitamin C)"". And as a little surprise bonus, they have added ""soy"". Soy?<br /><br />I asked my wife to taste this product with me. I poured the drink into two glasses and we both took a sip. Her reaction was swift and strong... she hated it. I agreed with her. It was for me, sickly sweet and left a sugary aftertaste in my mouth. Not only that, but the taste was just nasty. It didn't taste at all like orange or tangerine to me. It just tasted terribly sweet with an undefined cirtus something taste. The carbonation did not add anything positive to the experience. Neither of us finished drinking our 4oz portion. It went down the sink.<br /><br />I would not purchase this product in the future and if I could have given it 0-stars, I would have. It's that bad."

7021,B004K30HO2,Good Start but Could Be Better.,These cups work for the most part except for the fact that all most all of them leak out the top of the cap. All seem to wick some leakage through the paper filter at the cap and cup joint and approximately 10-15% overflow and leak around the cup and down the sides providing some grounds with the coffee.
59746,B001SER0L4,Constipating and possible tummy ache,This formula caused my baby to be very constipated. He's also not slept well since being on it (tummy ache?). I'm switching to Earth's best.<br />Also it doesn't fully mix or dissolve in the water. It appears grainy. I've also read bad things about the fact that it contains cane sugar (which can supposedly contribute to diabetes in later life and tooth decay now).
76899,B0045TVL6E,"Paleo Maybe, Not for me",I was disappointed with the taste and texture of these Tanka Buffalo Cranberry Bites.  I have followed the Paleo diet for over a year now and am accustomed to grass fed buffalo.  I'm not sure what happened with these.  Not tasty.
416578,B001E6GFKI,Product 19 from Amazon is excellent,I cannot find P-19 in any of my grocery stores.  Amazon has it and it is cheaper than I use to pay for it in the grocery store
39742,B005GIF5VU,Why can't I buy these in Canada!?,"I bought these when I was in the States (I live in Canada), and now my cat has a monkey on his back...and I can't buy them here! :(  And not only can I not buy them in Canada, I can't even order them on Amazon for reasons I don't fully understand. What am I going to do? His Royal Majesty (I mean the cat, of course) MUST have his Catnip Temptations! He's addicted. I can't drive down there in the winter when the roads are bad (like right now). He doesn't forget about them. It doesn't matter if I hide them. He knows. He watches me. He watches everyone who he thinks might give him his treats. I'm down to the last bag. I need...I need a Catnip Temptations dealer. Or I need to send him to Catnip Temptations Rehab."
3396,B005K4Q1VI,hot cocoa cups,"great price for the 24-count, my dad will love this gift since he loves hot chocolate and drinks about three cups a day, quick to receive."

8706,B003VXFK44,Pretty Good Decaf,"I switched to Decaf and was looking for a decent cup on the Keurig machine.  I was only interested in Subscribe and Save options.<br /><br />This is a fairly light roast, which I like.  I brew on the middle setting and I think if it was brewed any larger I would think it was too light."
124712,B000F0AUGO,Super Produkt,"Sehr gutes Produkt! Sehr gute Ware und scnelle Lieferung, wie immer &uuml;ber amazon.com. Alles bestens und gerne wieder. Danke daf&uuml;r"
28937,B0000VM8Y0,ARTIFICIAL flavor!,It is unfortunate that the wording of this item description doesn't make it clear that this is artificial flavor. Real vanilla is always brown because vanilla beans are brown. The artificial vanillas are by-products of wood processing and contain petro chemicals.  Do your taste buds and body a favor - use the real stuff even though your cake/frosting will not be pure white.
2622,B0016FY6H6,Good tea,This is good iced tea. It is hard to find locally in the Fall and Winter.
348258,B003GS3VQ8,yummy snacks,"the sahale snacks are fantastic.<br />delicious alone or add them to a salad. priced right.<br />when you finish one bag, you can't wait to open another"
76168,B0070N7IIC,"Check ingredients listed first, then be prepared to clean the canister","The listed ingredients at Amazon are correct but incomplete. Item also contains beef base (FIRST ingredient) & MSG (THIRD ingredient), neither of which we will eat in our household. Those ingredients were omitted on the product page by accident, they say. Really?!?!?!?!<br /><br />Moreover, the package we received contained crusted seasoning on the container, and the package was dusty & yucky. I literally had to wash the canister & use a bit of elbow grease before even reading the ingredient list! This is a food item, for gosh-sakes. Should have repackaged and refused delivery right then & there.<br /><br />A bad experience with Amazon with this one, that's for certain. Would have never purchased in-store, much less handled or brought into my home. I can't believe Amazon is shipping food products in this condition. I'll definitely reconsider my purchase of grocery items here."
206236,B000GG0BLQ,tea gotten the easy way,I received the order promply- all was in order--saved time and energy at the grocery store!
82375,B0009X2AB0,Bloody diarrhea,"My dog did well with this food for about a year, but the latest bag we purchased caused recurring bouts of profusely bloody diarrhea, resulting in an expensive trip to the emergency vet. I later found that there has been a recall of this pet food for possible salmonella contamination. We've switched to another brand, and she's doing great. I think I'll avoid this one in the future."
80602,B001EQ4G6I,Maxwell Hse filter packs,The convenience of this filter pack is essential...and makes it easier for me to brew coffee in spite of my disability.
54500,B001TLY7A8,My cat meows at me every morning,for this food! Sam loves this stuff and it's not as stinky as cheaper brands of canned catfood. I'm going to order other flavors for him to try.
535,B000G6RYNE,"Gaaak!  An ""extreme"" potato chip...!","The first time I tried these, I thought, ""WOW!"" but I quickly found they were just too darn spicy and tart... Hard to enjoy the potato-chippiness of them when your mouth is under seige."
355911,B002QWP8H0,Greenies are Great,"When I got my dog he was 6 and had recently had his teeth cleaned.  Now he is 13 and, with eating a greenie a day, has not needed to have them done again.  He loves these treats!"
58690,B0013P3KC6,Chalky taste,"This xylitol in packets is very chalky in taste.  I hate it!  So far, I have bought Now, Epic and Natrazyle xylitol, and the Now has been the only one not worth buying again.<br />Do yourself a favor and buy something else."
39489,B005EF0HYU,Completely addicting,"I can't keep these in my house, or I have to limit myself to one box every few weeks . . .too addicting!!"
65991,B0007A0AQW,not for spoiled/finicky dogs who prefer stella and chewys,"as a new dog owner, i made the mistake of feeding my dog super-premium, filler-free raw food and treats from stella and chewys since she was a pup. But because of the high price of Stella and Chewys, i switched to the Zukes mini chicken treats. My mini dachshund turned her nose up at the treats, over and over.  Even with nothing else to eat in the home, she actually preferred gnawing on her deer antler over the Zuke's.<br /><br />i'm not saying that these treats are bad at all---but it may be a waste of money for overindulged dogs with ""caviar tastes"" that have been spoiled by their owners (especially small companion dogs)."
52773,B002N3EIZ0,Slimey and disgusting!,"My initial taste of these roasted chestnuts were positive! However, after a week, the remaining chestnusts in the ziplock bag turned slimey and is covered with an unappetizing goo. I had to throw away the rest of the bag for fear of spoilage. DO NOT BUY!"
114856,B000EIN84S,favorable,What can I say - The order was fulfilled to my satisfaction. Nothing beyond that needs be said.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Joan Kershaw
78685,B00472I5A4,Good chips,I don't know what to say that others have not covered. If you like potato chips you will like these. Get em on sale when you can and limit your intake...if you can...
65113,B000EM8UFG,Very strange tasting tea.,I drink tea my entire life. Decided to try something different. Bad choice! This tea tastes awful to me. I do not like any cinnamon or any other spices in my tea. The Amazon description should include the list of ingredients for each product!
75783,B004MO6NI8,not sure about this product,"the color is somewhere between purple and brown<br /><br />the taste? some citrus, a lot of sweet<br /><br />the energy? didn't feel any after drinking a few sips, but then, after looking at the label and caffeine content...<br /><br />well, let's just say that i didn't finish this drink"
530171,B000AY9U3O,Great price!,"We eat a box a week of these crackers, so ordering in bulk from Amazon helps us cut costs!  And they deliver it to us monthly through subscribe and save!"
271118,B005Y2EKNW,YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMY,My colleague had bought these at the health store and I took a bite just now and basically DIED. I can't believe this is kale! it doesnt' even taste like kale. So yummy! I just ordered 5 packs from Amazon!
149094,B0029NIBE8,Repeat Buy,This is a Repeat Buy for me. My cats eat these and its cheaper and easier to buy in bulk.
301700,B001CFMGGI,"High Quality, Fair Price",The title of my listing days it all.  Comperable to a product I've purchased locally and some savings to boot.  Would purchase again.
3711,B0045IK1CK,"""Diet"" treat","I'm dieting, and I use these as a ""treat"" to myself, when I'm craving chocolate.  I usually brew one of these & one of my coffee K-cups (either plain or hazelnut).<br /><br />For 60 calories, it's not a bad way to satisfy a chocolate craving when you're on a ""calorie-budget!"""
37297,B003CK2BQG,Yuck!,"I always buy Bigelow's green tea (which aside from the need to use two teabags per cup due to weakness, is satisfactory). Still, I thought I'd give Stash's a go. I immediately knew that I would soon regret doing so when I opened the first tea packet-the smell! Like a stagnant swamp! To make matters worse, it taste like what I would imagine swamp water would taste like. Honey doesn't do much to improve upon the flavor, either. Perhaps this is what people mean when they describe a green tea as ""grassy""? At any rate, I won't be revisiting this one."
1353,B0046HFHD8,Darn Good!,We received a box of these at work and the whole package was gone moments after opening it up!  Great biscuits and now I am ordering a couple boxes for a few gifts for people I can't figure out what to get...
67552,B0069TZRCM,Dog didn't like them,"Well i gave my dog one of these, and she puked twice. Soooo needless to say i just threw the rest out."

193415,B0001590LO,Only kind my husband will eat!,"My South African husband worships this stuff.  Only thing he'll eat and he'll just about put it on anything if I'd let him!  He can't find anything like it in our local grocery store, so we have to order it regularly."
4342,B004391DK0,Just like the Bisquick you remember,"I find the gluten-free Bisquick pancake mix to be just as easy to use as the original Bisquick, and I like the flavor just fine (not much different than regular Bisquick).  It's easy to make the pancakes, just add milk, oil, an egg, mix, and pour on the griddle.  Cooking time seems to be about the same, and the consistency of the pancakes is just like regular pancakes.  I would definitely recommend this mix to anyone needing gluten-free products."
165495,B0052MH1M6,I don't understand why you would pay twice the price,This price for the Nespresso capsules are twice the price from the official site.  It makes me wonder about everything else listed.
3088,B001SB1R7A,Yummy!,Love this hot chocolate--nice creamy flavor.  The price is good and I love the single packs.  This is not a flavor available to me locally.
7728,B001E5DZTS,Not 4 Infants,"Others may have a different experience. We were using this as a supplement to mother's milk because mother's milk just did not seem to provide enough fat / protein for baby to gain weight. Problem, although stated that Goat's milk is easier to digest, we found that once we mixed the goat milk with mother's milk, she ate more infrequently and got constipated with indegestion. We had bought this to help with digestion, as Formula is based on cow's milk. This goat's milk seemed to have the opposite effect on our baby, and she didn't gain weight. Also, the taste isn't so great.<br /><br />We can use it as back up, in case we don't have milk in the fridge. So, it's OK, but I probably won't buy again."
870,B000VKYKTG,Great Buy,"These where great couldnt stop eating them.<br />Lowest priced anywhere and will buy even more next time.<br />Cant say enough about these, they where shipped faster than what I paid to have shipped also.<br />Thank you so much."
475988,B000L87PEU,BEST,"I'd give this stuff 10 stars.  It's so, so yummy!  I wish it would come in a larger bottle, I run out of it in no time.  By the way.......you can get this for $18 on the O Olive Oil site."
214,B0009XLVGA,CHANGED FORMULA MAKES CATS SICK!!!!,"As with canidae, Felidae has also changed their formula.  Cats do not like change when it comes to their food.  And they just had to change it without putting it on their label.  We noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell.  (As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae, and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues.)<br /><br />Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home.  If cats get ""upset"" because of a change in enviorment, or a loud noise they can stop eating.  It depends on the cat.  Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight.  We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal.  It has been a year since then and they are better.  Then the formula for this food changed.<br /><br />We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us.  We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food.  It wasn't until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick.  Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and haven't suffered one bit like our dogs have.<br /><br />Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating.  Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it!  We have 5 rescued and fixed cats, none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula.<br /><br />I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal.  As with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals, and tell me not to buy it.  This is just horrible!"
67548,B0005ZH9UO,imported italian canned tomatoes,"ripe , firm , deep red and sweet......best canned tomatoes on the market......san diego ca."
226,B001SATU8E,DELICIOUS,"Makes a tasty, super easy meal, fast. BUT high in calories.<br /><br />The instructions say to saute the veggies first but I recommend cooking the chicken first. The chicken takes longer to cook and the raw chicken ontop of veggies just makes a slimy mess. I made it with snow peas and carrots only. I dont like the little corn.  Added some red pepper flakes for heat and served ontop of rice.  It came out wonderful! Dinner on the table in less than 30mins."
79774,B001IZM92S,"these are not rings, and have lots of the core left",we'd bought them because they were in washington state. but they are dried hotter and are therefore crisper than other apple rings. and they have lots of core bits which are very hard

5156,B0031YJ38W,poor quality control.... moldy,"My kids love these, and we've ordered them often - but as was the case with at least one other reviewer, this batch came in with some mold. (I freeze them as soon as they arrive, so had the have been moldy upon arrival.)<br /><br />too bad - but at this price, won't run the risk of having to toss out product."
269161,B00004RAMS,Mole Trap,"Just recently set the mole trap.  Haven't caught the critter yet, but hope to.  Trap is well made and designed and should bring results."
2212,B0007T3V82,Nice!,We purchased these for our son to give out when his baby boy is born.  They make a very nice announcement of the new arrival.  They are however very hard if you actually want to chew the bubble gum.
1793,B001RVFDOO,Can someone post some of the nutrition facts?,"I am interested in these but was wondering if someone that has them could post some nutrition info on them? Mainly, fat, fiber, sugars, and then any vitamins? Thanks so much!!"
916,B000ER6YO0,Too runny...,"My baby LOVES sweet potatoes. I can essentially mix any food into sweet potatoes and he will eat them; which in this case could be a good or bad thing depending on what I wanted to mix in there... it was horribly runny, like spooning formula into his mouth. Ick."
52504,B003ANFMY8,Worth the money!,"Our cat was a stray that showed up at a friend's farm.  He was in very bad shape...very skinny, lethargic, and his fur was very wiry!  We got him on the mend with a visit to the vet and some antibiotics.  But it wasn't until we started feeding him Science Diet that we noticed the change in his fur.  It made such a vast difference!  He has the softest fur I have ever felt on a cat!  The Science Diet seems to help with the hairballs, too.  It is a bit expensive, but it's worth every penny to me."
75750,B004MO6NI8,"Yucky Tasting and High in Sugar, Carbs and Calories","I prefer Monster or Rockstar energy drinks, but I am always trying new one's because I like variety. The first thing that I noticed when I got this can was the amount of sugar, carbs and calories in this can. It is ridiculous! 260 calories, 66 gm of Sugar and 68 carbs per can. There is supposedly 2 servings per can, but who drinks just half a can? Plus, in can form it is hard to save.<br /><br />Now for the taste: in my opinion this tasted like sour passion fruit. It was nasty! I wasn't able to drink more than two sips because I found it so repulsive. I realize that people's taste buds are different and some people may love the taste, but I hated it. I recommend trying <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004WQ1NT0"">16 Pack - Monster Rehab - Tea + Lemonade + Energy - 15.5oz.</a> if you want a great tasting drink that is low in carbs, sugar and calories."

6294,B00061U6AW,Yummy!!!,"The actual product deserves 5 stars, the reason I gave it 4 stars is because its like three dollars at asianfoodgrocer.com. That's where I order it from, not amazon. Much lower prices."
79656,B0009XVYA8,"Want your dog dead?  If so, buy this product!","I was in a hurry as I shopped at my local pet food store late on a Saturday night.  My dogs needed dog food.  I buy a high quality dog food, it's ingredients contain everything my vet wants me to be feeding me dogs. I also wanted to get them some special treats. But in my haste I picked up a bag of these ""gourmet"" chicken breast treats.  Usually I read the label on everything I give my dogs.  Not this time, they looked healthy and were very similar to other chicken breast treats I normally buy.  Had I carefully read the back of the bag I would have immediately returned them to the shelf and moved on.  The words on the back of the bag ""not for human consumption, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling this product""-""made in China"" would have tipped me off!!!  I never saw these warnings until after my beloved jack russell became very ill only mere hours after eating one of these treats.  My vet wanted to know what had she eaten that was different?  I handed him the bag-he looked it over in horror.  My dog developed an obstruction from the treat, which caused bloat because nothing could pass, salmonella and e-coli poisoning, and an infection in her heart giving her a 4/6 heart murmur.  She had to undergo expoloratory surgery, 7 sets of xrays, 2 ultrasounds, multiple blood tests,an ecg and we're not done yet.  She is still in recovery, tests still pending.  This was one of the healthiest dogs my vet cared for before this incident.  Never had a health issue in the past, never a heart murmur.  At 9 years old most people thought she was 3 or 4.  I have been told the heart murmur has been caused by the infection settling in her heart, which is now irreversable.  Which means if she makes it through all of this her life expectancy just went from 16+ to 10 or 11.<br />My vet cultured one of the treats and could not believe what disease and bacteria it was loaded with.  I cannot believe I took such good care of her for 9 years and then put her through all of this suffering because I didn't take the time to carefully look the product over. Thank you, Cadet and IMS Pet Products for contributing to my dog's pain and suffering."
12188,B00141UC9I,Ten Stars,"Having multuple dogs to feed snacks to I can tell you this is their number one choice, hands down. Helping with hip relief is an added perk. This item should get a TEN star rating."
8331,B003VXFK44,Bitter taste,"I tried this product solely for the fact it has Wolfgang's name on it.  I should have stuck with Timothy's brand.  This was way too strong to be labeled a breakfast coffee, more like a dinner coffee.  I will not be buying this again, also way too expensive compared to the others."
53013,B001652NBM,Wrong quantity,"I only got pack of 12 but not as it was said pack of 48,because my husband placed this order,  When i got the package i just felt strange they used a so big box for this small stuff,, and I  did not realize the quantity was wrong until today I checked my account. But  now I already finished most  cookies ,and I think everything is late ."
522627,B007TJGZ0Y,Butter Toffee Yummmm!!!!!!!,This variety is one of my daughter & my favorites & I try to keep it on hand at all times.
440,B000G6RYNE,A unique flavor for fans of Thai food,"These Kettle Brand potato chips in the Spicy Thai flavor really do taste like food I have eaten at a Thai restaurant. The ingredients listed include garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, jalapeno, and ""spices."" I'm not sure what other spices there are, but it sure tastes like lemongrass to me...yum. These chips are thick cut and very crunch. They come in a seriously heavy-duty bag. I tried to open it like I do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart; no way! The bag is so thick I wondered if it was plastic. I started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it. Sure enough, there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions ""tear here."" So easy. Why didn't I think of that."
525134,B001FZ0SVA,love that these are yogurt flavor!  my dog loves booda bones!,I have no problem w/my dog eating these.  He loves these booda bones. I had never seen the yogurt ones; he loves them.
22925,B004ZIER34,Nice Flavor!,It had a nice flavor and as far as it goes compared to other coffee I could not tell the difference. Having less acid I could not tell. It tasted like regular coffee and did not have a bad after taste.
944,B000ER6YO0,"Baby loves it, but there is plastic in it","This is my daughter's  most favorite baby food by far.  This is the only ones she'll eat and rarely will eat the other kinds.  However, the taste is very bland, for me as an adult at least. After you put the unfinished portion in the fridge, it may become sort of watery at which point I throw it out. It is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has, especially zucchini.<br />I had to update my review today, because I saw little pieces of thin stretchy plastic in two jars of this baby food.  PLASTIC IN BABY FOOD? I notified Earth's Best about it and will be sending them these pieces of plastic for testing, but I am not giving my baby this food any more, even though she likes it, that's it for us."
553675,B004W50NFG,brewed cocoa beans is not hot chocolate,I have tried 2 brands of brewed cocoa beans and don't care for either.  I will stick to my tea.
14431,B00284TR82,a mess,this item arrived with a horrible mess. broken and sticky. i want my money back! i am so dissappointed. i expected better from amazon.
414375,B001ELJK78,Seems fine,Definitely add 3 lbs of sugar to raise the sp. gr. Make 5 gal rather than 6.  Package arrived in tact.
4331,B004391DK0,great  product,this is a great product. Perfect for the celiac searching for biscuit mix or pancake mix that actually tastes good.  Also great topping for chicken pot pie.
3577,B0044UT0O4,"Unique and tart flavor, delicious!","Delicious and unique flavor, great for those who like a little tart taste. Nice the have a 12 pack since they are pretty hard to find."
54143,B001MABOUC,Disappointing quantity...,"Well ordered this as a gift for my uncle's birthday.  I am SHOCKED To see how little the quantity was.  I mean, there is probably a handful of each variety of nuts in this gift box.  And it's not like any gourmet flavored nuts..  SO I really did expect the gift box to be rather big with a very generous amount stuffed in them.  The nuts are packed in the shown plain wooden tray and clear wrap on top  and the chocolate box is tied together with some ribbon.  Very Ordinary.  I just cannot get over the fact that I spent $90 plus tax on this giftbox.  It would have been better priced at around $40.<br /><br />SO if you are looking to make a statement with a nice gift basket/tray...  this is DEFINITELY NOT IT!!<br /><br />Since it was a gift.. I cannot really comment on the quality of the contents..<br /><br />If I had more time I would have definitely returned and purchased something else.  Unfortunately I just spend $100 for a simple gift and paid $35 for 1 day shipping..  SO feeling terribly disappointed with myself for not paying more attention to the amounts and quantity provided in the description :-("
252670,B001EQ5ERI,"Good espresso, fair price","I like this espresso. The taste il milder than the Lavazza Gold, but this one is cheaper."
5044,B0026RHUP8,Our choice of formula,We had to move to formula when our baby was 8 weeks. We have found Enfamil Premium to mix easier than the regular Enfamil Lipil. Our baby has had no digestive issues from the formula. I love getting it in bulk from Amazon as it saves the weekly trip to the store for formula. The price (with free shipping) is comparable with local grocery stores in the Austin Area.
54549,B001TLY7A8,If I could I would give it a negative billion stars...,"The food was rotten/old. Not sure if that's amazons fault but thank god they gave me a refund. It smelled absolutely horrible. I tried to give her a can, or let her 'sniff' it, that looked and smelled normal and she looked at me like I was crazy. I would say almost clawed my eyeball out. I would've never let her actually eat it but I heard cats can smell CRAP food. Maybe I was just unlucky but based on that I'm never purchasing this crap again."
3897,B000A40OVQ,Great for Tortillas!,"This makes the best tortillas.  That is about all I use this for, so it lasts me awhile.<br />Mine cost about 1/2 the price as listed here, but it was on sale where I bought it too."
61779,B003SLTETG,Worth Every Penny !,"We have had this door for over a year and it has been one of the best things I have ever purchased! We have three dogs, two large older dogs, and one small. We used to spend our day letting them out 100 times to chase squirrels only to let them back in two minutes later. The barking to go in and out was constant. Now their behavior is completely different. They let themselves in and out, no more barking, and freedom for us! When we are at work or gone long periods of time, we no longer worry about getting home to let them out. The only problem we have had with the door is that when it is really cold (teens or below), the door sometimes goes up and down a few times before it finally closes. Keeping in mind that it has probably opened and closed 600,000 times in the last year, I am happy with it's track record. One of our older dogs is afraid of everything... cameras, phones, etc. I was afraid she would be too afraid to use it. With some treats she learned to use it in about 15 minutes and has had no problem since. Great product!"
192003,B000Q5X876,Great for my kids,This is a really great snack for kids.  The fact that they are organic is a big plus and it takes no arm-twisting at all for the kids to eat them.  Only complaint I have is that they are a bit expensive.
8030,B000ZZVKDQ,wine country gal,"My dughter used these, and loved the fresh taste of the tomatoes!  Said it was like she had just picked them fron a garden!"
4009,B00110FN28,Bad flavor combination,"I purchased these thinking they would just be ordinary oatmeal raisin cookies. Wrong! I like chocolate chip and I like oatmeal raisin but these combination cookies just don't work well together. I wish I had read the item listing more carefully. Even my kids said ""Blech!""."
108323,B007TJGY46,spewing coffee grounds all over,these pods are defective . They spew coffee grounds all over the place and in the cup of coffee. I use others and this is the only one I've had a problem with!
41305,B00427ZLOM,Dented cans,"I ordered 2 cases of Halo cat food for a total of 24 cans.  Fully half the cans arrived seriously dented to the point that I wonder if the food inside is still viable.  It also makes me wonder if the supplier is offloading ""seconds"" to Amazon consumers....that would NOT be cool.  I came to Amazon to avoid Petco, the only local supplier.  But badly dented cans may force me to look elsewhere for the product which my cat enjoys."
1962,B004H4R0YO,Great Cooking Oil !,"Love this Balance Blend of Oils , especially in mix batters such as : Pancake , Cornbread ,Cake , Etc... , a good oil to ingest !"
332258,B000PU785K,The picture is not for the same product,The picture is not of the same product and have Tfjot when I saw the difference and that is my request not be
310,B003YDP5PA,Fantastic!,"This tri-color couscous is really good...full of flavor and fun to eat.  I love the texture.  I cook in chicken broth and add some minced garlic and chopped herbs (parsley, cilantro,) along with some red pepper flakes.  At the end of cooking, I add some olive oil and this makes a wonderful side dish...Highly recommend"
28090,B007POT6RM,Nasty NASTY stuff!,"This USED to be my favorite breakfast, but now that they've fallen in line with the Nanny State of The Union and forcibly are choosing our lifestyle and food ingredients, this product is crapola, plain and simple. It used to be wonderful but now is not fit to feed my cat. ( I tried but she wouldn't eat it, either ) Worst stuff I ever tasted when it comes to oatmeal. And what is that horrible biting bitter flavor they substituted for brown sugar or real maple flavoring? Smells and tastes like something left in a cranky baby's diaper. Quaker has lost another customer."
28336,B00485BIKY,Poor Quality,"Material is very thin and the shirt had several spots where the color was faded.<br />The only thing that it had going for it was the fact that it was cheap, but I guess sometimes you get what you pay for."
632,B000G6RYNE,Love the smaller bags!,My 8 yo is a Kettle chip addict so I was so happy to find snack size bags for his lunch!!! Great quality and much cheaper than in the stores!!! Will definitely be buying more!
270983,B000EQSAIY,the best sea salt,"but, I will admit, I bring my home from France where I get it for a fraction of the cost in the local grocery store."
810,B0030C9A60,Chocolate - How can you go wrong?,Great for serving Chocolate liquor. Adds a touch of class to your event and elevates you to host supreme. Being able to eat the cup afterwards is just icing on the cake.
4330,B004391DK0,Wallpaper Paste,"I read lots of good reviews and loved the idea of the convenience of this mix for pancakes and waffles.  So I whipped up some pancakes, breakfast-for-dinner style.  I'm newly diagnosed celiac and thus new to GF, so perhaps I should let a little more time go by on just a diet of naturally gluten free foods before I start trying substitute foods for the wheat foods I used to love, but I swear I cried a little bit when I ate these pancakes.  Because I thought they sucked, frankly.  They are completely bland and have no flavor at ALL, and the texture was reminiscent of wallpaper paste. (I don't know if that's gluten free but if so it's probably cheaper to just put some syrup on that and eat it!) After letting the batter stand 10 minutes to thicken up a bit, it was more like kindergarten paste, but still totally flavorless.  My 2 year old daughter gobbled them up, so that's something.  Then I cried a litle bit more thinking about the fact that I guess I'll never get to teach her how to make a real, delicious fluffy wheat pancake, but that's a whole other thing.<br /><br />I'm giving it 2 stars just because it is useful for breading oven baked chicken, but you could do that more economically with another GF flour."
410471,B001EPQEAU,Who doesn't love Moma Leone's?,You got to taste this mix you would think you made it from scratch.
6398,B003CB0VAI,High Quality Jerky.,"Taste: Amazing. The honey flavor goes well with the smoked barbeque taste. It's soft, but not too soft. It also has a nice tang and spice to it, but nothing too extreme.<br />Smell: As soon as I opened it, everyone in my section ran up to see what the smell was. I'd describe it as alluring and inviting. Not overpowering or off-putting.<br />Price: For a pound of this quality of jerky, I'd expect it would cost more. Needless to say, you get more bang for your buck.<br /><br />In short, if you want a good jerky to snack on, you can't go wrong with this selection. Do your tastebuds a favor and get this jerky."
80348,B0002XAG36,Was not impressed,"I was disappointed in this product especially considering how exceptional the Salmon Oil they make is.<br /><br />This did not pass the 11 rescue dog test! They just turned up their noses. So did the other dogs here. Very tiny tidbits, as well.Buy an extra bottle of the Grizzly Salmon oil instead."
376736,B000NMCEJK,Item not as described!,"I ordered this 56 ounce bag of M&Ms, but what I received was a box of 3.27 ounce bags.  I don't like being misled when purchasing things online."
1316,B00110GBII,Much better than milk chocolate!,We love strawberries dipped in chocolate but locally we could not find the dark chocolate type - so glad we found this at Amazon - it is WONDERFUL!
173649,B004L2XXCU,ADDICTING,"These chips are so ADDICTING. Let me tell you how addicting they are, they are so addicting that whoops I used up my 20 word minimum already.<br />ADDICTING!"
182690,B000W5SLEU,great for picky eaters,we mix this food with royal canin for our morkie - who is a finicky eater - he loves it.
2735,B003NDA970,Tops in the Popcorn World,This popcorn is really great!  We enjoy the taste and the smallness of the actual popcorn.  Its not like the popcorn that is big and fluffy its small and really great to eat.  I eat only this popcorn now and order every three months. Highly recommend to the popcorn lovers of the world.
318685,B001E5E33U,Excellent!,I order this tea for my husband and he loves it anytime of the day or evening.
318536,B000NGP8UI,Missing items,"I only received 19 cans when I paid for 24. Also, two cans were busted. I am $10 short from this order."
557027,B000H0ZJHW,Treats,"I don't know who created these treats, but my puppy loves them.  They have a dog smell so I would recommend you keep the packaging sealed or your dog will get into the package!!!"
559625,B001E8DHPW,good product,"husband is using every day and says there is no coconut taste.  he adds it to his oatmeal every morning.  just a note to those purchasing it, it does have a low melting temp!"
9384,B006N3IG4K,Taste like old socks,I thought this coffee was really horrible. Had one cup and will throw the rest away because it can't be returned.
9099,B006N3IG4K,This coffee is now DECAFF!,"One reviewer mentioned that this coffee was decaff and said it was listed as such on the bottom of the box (in small print). I checked my current box and saw no such labeling information. HOWEVER, the new boxes I received are a different color, with a slapped on label for Hawaiian Hazelnut and NOW the bottom of the box says it's made from 100% decaff coffee. While I like the flavor, I do NOT want decaff in the morning, which is when I drink coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am unable to return this item to Amazon because of their return policy, which is why I'm writing this review, to make sure others know the coffee packaging has changed and it is definitely labeled as decaffeinated now. I would give more stars for flavor, but the lack of official notification in the product description that this coffee is decaff makes me feel as if I tossed my money out the window, buying something I would not have otherwise ordered."
414441,B000SE2T3O,Warning:  May not be Key Lime juice,"I saw another review saying this, so I called the company and asked:  Is there ANY key lime juice in this?  And guess what, they REFUSED to answer me.<br /><br />If you want real key lime juice I would avoid this product."
8666,B003VXFK44,Simply - It's terrible,"If Keurig brewers were evaluated by this particular K-Cup, Keurig would be out of business. Wolfgang Puck - French Roast Melange Francais is inexcusably terrible coffee. Aroma hints of singed oak leave and the top note is simply bitter.  Mid taste is like the bottom ounces of a days old Kwiki-Mart carafe.  Mouth feel is harsh and leaves an appalling coating. The after taste leads one to immediately brush ones teeth.  I simply couldn't believe my Keurig was capable of making such a bad cup of coffee, so I tried again a week later with same results. I use average-to-good filtered water and have no problems with other brands like Green Mountain, Tulleys, nor Emeril's. Everyone I know that has a Keurig learned of it via word of mouth or a shared cup. Usually the results are stunning, and the Keurig invasion lives on.  When I share I'll stick with offering The Coffee Peoples' Black Tiger or Jet Fuel. Now I have 22 more WP/FR K-cups sitting in the bottom draw of my china cabinet to get rid of. Let me know if you want them, as I'd be embarrassed to even give them away.  Sorry Wolfgang, but what the Puck - your French Roast is unpardonably horrible, and at K-cup prices I'll not be duped again. I'll stay away from any of the other WP offerings."
5228,B0009OMU00,Great Snack,This mix is great anytime.  I love it.  Would recommend it to anyone that likes Chex mix.
5268,B0012YEKCW,great product,"It got here fast, grew quickly and my cats love it. Excellent choice anyone can make their cats very happy by purchasing this product, plus my cats have completely stopped chewing on all other plants in the house."
25175,B0081XIA1E,Not a happy camper,My Morkie had this ball for exactly 5 minutes and tore the rubber!  I am very disappointed because the concept is exactly what she needs!!
112722,B000FEFEWA,Pricing increased dramatically: up over 51%,I've been receiving these via Subscribe and Save for several years.  The price just went from $13.07 to $19.75.  Bye Bye.
8045,B00374MU8G,Healthy Treat,"All of us like to give treats to our pets, but some of them are just too high in fat or too calorie laden.  My dog was just diagnosed with diabetes, and our vet suggested we use these chicken bits as her treats instead of the normal Milk Bone type biscuits. They are very low in fat and high in protein, very chewy and my dog just LOVES them.  I wish the treats were a bit larger for my Lab,so I end up giving her two.  If you have a smaller dog, they also make these treats in a smaller size.  Also these are just the right size to use as treats if you are training your dog."
3213,B005K4Q1VI,Disgusting,"Looks like and tastes like chocolate colored water. No chocolate flavor whatsoever, this was a complete disappointment.  I got the hot chocolate k-cups from swiss miss instead.  How people can be giving this product four and five stars is astounding to me, is the Amazon ratings system being gamed for this product?"
5739,B003TIVBSU,"beans, beans, the magical fruit!","I just got these, they are moist and gooey and fresh.  I actually got more beans than the approximate ammount.  They came faster than expected.  Great transaction!"
34219,B001P3NU30,Awesome product!!,"My 11-year old Akita's teeth sparkled after 2 weeks of use.  She chews it for at least 10 minutes.  She breaks part of it off, softens it with her saliva and then swallows it with ease.  No more doggy breath and her teeth looks amazing!  I read how other dogs choke on it, but mine did not have a problem.  I suspect those other dogs were not used to chewing on things like rawhide so they don't know how to chew it to soften it up, then swallow. They probably try to swallow it whole or in parts (not a good idea)."
90819,B00473X468,Peanut Butter Eggs,Reese's peanut butter eggs were delivered with chocolate melted.  Amazon should not sell chocolate items unless they can guarantee they will be delivered unmelted!! I will never buy anything with chocolate again!
815,B004ET7MG8,"Good sugarless gum, with stronger gum for better bubble blowing than other sugarless gums","Besides that mentioned in the title, the only other remarks I have about it is the price is hard to beat, the taste is akin to a Flintstone strawberry vitamin (for those of you that have tasted them), and taste lasts for not very long.  I'd say, on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 lasting an extraordinary amount of time this would be a 3.  Also, the taste really diminishes to a subdued sweet after a very short amount of time."
47945,B004SRH2B6,Less Potassium per Ounce then the Boxes because it's not Pure,"I was fooled into getting this as BJ's because it was cheaper then the boxes, and there is a reason! It's not pure and it tastes like crap. It has a lot less Potassium in the 14 ounce bottom (569) compared to 700+ in the boxes that are 3 ounces smaller! Stick with the boxes, trust me!"
3756,B00016UX0K,My favorite sauce at Tijuana Flats,"I purchased this sauce as it is the exact same sauce used at the hot sauce bar of Tijuana Flats (http://www.tijuanaflats.com/).  It goes amazing with steak tostadas but in my home cooking, it works wells as a marinade and as a condiment."
476028,B0018MMCWS,Regret purchasing this decaf tea,"Lacks tea flavor. I fail to understand 4 and 5 star reviews based on which I bought this product. I have tried PG Tips, Typhoo and Barry's and all of them are better than Taylors of Harrogate."
516921,B001SIXXWU,Soldiers love it,We support a number of soldiers deployed to Afghanistan and several of them request peppered jerky above everything else.
125901,B0007N218O,perfect breath saver,"Lakerol not only freshens your breath but also will help with sinus congestion. For an inetersting drink, add 1 box of Lakerol to 1 pint of vodka - yum!"
50904,B00139C3P2,took a gamble on this product.. and lost....,"i was wondering why it was so much cheaper than the other flavors... now I know... my cat wouldnt touch it. He acted like it stunk and backed away.<br />he then went over to eat his day old dried cat food rather than eat this junk.<br />Im concerned that someone wrote it might be tainted and be recalled later. well ill save it in case it does get recalled-maybe then i can get a refund. i dont like how amazon wont let you return food items(unless recalled), especially when they are just unopened cans.<br /><br />alot of people gave it good ratings but alot of people didnt.. I think if you only have one cat like me, the odds are bad... and you shouldnt buy it."
371162,B0073GJ1TK,My dog love this,I didnt buy this from amazon however my dog loves this food. I have always had a problem with her wanting to eat but with this food she stands by her bowl waiting. I think I have found the food I have been looking for.
3331,B005K4Q1VI,Great hot chocolate and reasonable price,My kids have been begging for hot cocoa k-cups and when I found these so reasonably priced I decided to give them a try.  We all loved them.
4198,B004391DK0,makes a proper pancake,"In trying to eat a little healthier I'm reducing my gluten intake (gluten/wheat may not be the best for arthritis/inflammation) so I gave this gluten free Bisquick a try. Surprisingly, I was pretty impressed with the flavor which to me tastes almost as good as regular Bisquick.<br /><br />I followed a reviewer's suggestion to let the batter sit for about 15 minutes after adding just the milk; the batter looked better and was a nicer consistency after the resting time. It was a little hard to get all the lumps out of the batter though and because I have limited GF experience I wasn't sure whether further stirring would gum it up so I left some lumps in and they dissolved while cooking.<br /><br />The texture of the cooked pancakes was very SLIGHTLY gritty. Makes pancakes a little thinner than with regular Bisquick however thick enough that I'd say they are just right. See photo added.<br /><br />I used a cast iron griddle to make the pancakes, which made them barely crisp outside and nice tender inside - *very* good!!!<br /><br />The taste is close to regular Bisquick but a little more ""plain"" - I use real maple syrup and sometimes preserves and with either of the two toppings, I had a very good, very tasty short stack.<br /><br />My only quibble is that this mix is a little pricey but I'd rather buy this mix than other GF products I've tried that are just as pricey and don't taste nearly as good."
7775,B000G7VYWU,"Great ""On the Go"" snack!",Great on the go snack to take in the car for my 3 and 5 year old! NO MESSY HANDS like other snacks. Keeps the car much cleaner! :) Also great for me as a Weight Watcher snack with a wedge of Laughing Cow Lite Cheese! YUM!!!
71922,B004GUQ8Q0,Update of previous review,"This is a resubmittal of a previous review.  Originally, when I received my cheesecake I was very disappointed with the careless way it had been packaged and delivered - and I said so in my review.  I NOW say that if anybody ever says that Omaha Steakes doesn't care about their product feedback, do NOT believe it.  After submitting my original review, I was contacted by Mr. Sendgraff of Omaha Steaks who apologized for their poor packaging and inormed me that Omaha Steaks has a 100% satisfaction guarantee on all their products and, that he was refunding my entire purchase price, including shipping.  Even after I told him we had eaten the cheesecake, and it was really quite good, he insisted that my experience had not met their 100% satisfaction guarantee standards and my refund would stand.  I say, THANK YOU, Mr. Sendgraff, you are a credit to Omaha Steaks Customer Service and have restored my confidence completely.  I'm looking forward to my next purchase of an Omaha Steaks product."
38523,B004S036D6,Delivered badly dented.,"Of 6 cans, 5 cans were badly dented. It looked like someone may have dented them with a hammer. Don't take a chance. Stay away from this product."
213489,B001HWGKV8,YUM YUM,OUR BEAGLE JUST  LOVES THIS PRODUCT<br />SHE TAKES ONE WITH HER WHEREVER SHE GOES<br />ESPECIALLY LIKES O CHEW WHILE IN THE CAR
14462,B00284TR82,Call it luck!,"It might have been luck or the fact that I ordered some other products as well, but I managed to get a box of these without ANY of them leaking.  No sticky mess, just a few dented, which can be expected.  Box was inside a bigger box with a few other items and some air bags.  Great creamer without the sticky mess!"
384851,B002FYG2N8,no MSG? ahem,It contains autolyzed yeast extract  which is equivalent to MSG.  I checked the nutrition info on their website and it wasn't included in the list of ingredients so I grabbed a box I had in the kitchen and it was listed there.
299000,B001ACIAE0,Paula Deen-go to cooking school,These mixes are not quality-i like Barefoot contessa products better-i like Betty Crocker better-paula this stuff will ruin your image
3295,B005K4Q1VI,Too watery after multiple settings.,"A hot chocolate packet was the first K-Cup on my new Keurig (it was 1 a.m. and I wasn't ready for coffee before bed). I had read they ran a little watery but I decided to try it on the 10 oz. setting, took a sip, and tossed it. The next morning I made one with 8 oz. and added some whipped cream. The taste was kind of grainy and it was still pretty watery. My husband made one to try at 6 oz. and said it tasted like sugar water. I might try combining 2-3 6 oz. servings to use the box up but we won't be buying more."
50501,B000WABSYU,Not what it is cracked up to be,My cats won't eat it.  I have kept it out for two weeks and they would starve before they ate enough to survive.
44404,B0018OMTOM,Dog likes it but I don't.,"The ingredients read this as a healthy treat, and my dog does really enjoy them, but oh wow, these things smell horrible!  Absolutely horrible, and I like fish! I tried to tolerate it, but it really turns my stomach.  The smell sticks to your fingers too, I have to wash my hands after giving my dog just one of these because the smell is still so offensive.  Yuck.  I'm gonna give the chickens ones a try, but the salmon is going back."
1106,B0025ULYKI,uncle rays barbeque chips,"I love uncle ray's potatoe chips. They have alot of spice on each chip.  They taste spicy with a tang of sweet. When I order a box, I pass them out to friends who love them. My husband, my kids and I eat a whole bag at a time.  I limit myself to ordering only twice ayear. The salt content makes me blow up, but I still love them."
51156,B000FIXT2I,Better than slow cooked rice,I am always hesitant with microwave rice - because of the uneven cooking and texture.  This was NOT the case with this product.  The rice cooks in it's package in less than 2 mins and comes out better than if I have simmered it myself for 45 mins.  I will replace all my slow cook brown rice with this product.
462285,B006N3I7JO,good coffee,This was for my husband. he likes the coffee and loves the fact he can have a cup in the morning before work
36331,B002KAL1B0,THE VERY BEST YOU CAN BUY!,"My baby had a horrible reaction to Similac.  He could not suck and breathe at the same time.  He made terrible noises while trying to suck and you had to take the bottle out of his mouth every 15 seconds so he would not choke.<br /><br />We took him to a ""specialist"" at Miami Children's Hospital.  The doctor said that it was NOT THE FORMULA.  He put my baby through some test where the baby was screaming terribly.  Then he wanted us to come back so he could stick a camera down his esophagus. We never went back. We changed his formula to Baby's Only and the problem immediately went away on the first bottle!<br /><br />I firmly believe that the baby would have been quickly given a feeding tube.  That's how bad he was on the Similac! By the way, all the other infant formulas are the same as the similac. It has do do with the DHA that is derived from fungus and algae and also that they are genetically modified.<br /><br />EVERY BABY THAT IS NOT ON BREASTMILK SHOULD BE ON THIS!"
7707,B001E5DZTS,It's Goat-tastic,"This is by far the best tasting thing that's come from a goat in years! Bullsburg Creamery, Man Chowder Dairy or Goat Coat can't hold a candle to this stuff. Drink it, bake it, snort it...it's all good."
10035,B001CGTN1S,tasted yuk,Gave it to my daughter who uses it in recipes but I wanted to use it in smoothies.  It tasted to bad to me.
1202,B008L19ZQ0,I was able to eat bread again!,Since being gluten free I've tried all types of GF breads and they are all very expensive. Who knew that the brazilians had the bread game on lock with this inexpensive tapioca version of cheese bread! It's custom which is probably why they are all so skinny! lol But I loved it and will be ordering a whole lot more!
55,B002GWHC0G,Roasts up a smooth brew,"I roast at home with a stove-top popcorn popper (but I do it outside, of course). These beans (Coffee Bean Direct Green Mexican Altura) seem to be well-suited for this method. The first and second cracks are distinct, and I've roasted the beans from medium to slightly dark with great results every time. The aroma is strong and persistent. The taste is smooth, velvety, yet lively."
424039,B001EPPB9A,CAUTION ... contents are ADDICTIVE!,Do yourself a favor and DON'T order this if you tend to eat sweetened condensed milk with a spoon!  One taste and you're hooked!!!!!
192075,B000HDEHSQ,Creamy chowder,I like this chowder with crackers and sometimes I just heat it and pour it over a baked potato.
9371,B006N3IG4K,WORST COFFEE I'VE EVER HAD!,This Wolfgang Puck Coffee Jamaica Me Crazy is the worst coffee I've ever had!<br />I threw it out right away after one sip! It taste like all coconut flavoring.<br />Hard to believe someone thought this taste good and was marketable. They should be fired!
18618,B000F4H5F4,Not as good as it used to be,"I am disappointed in the quality of this and of the Darjeeling loose teas. Years ago when I used Twinings regularly, it was of a higher quality. Then I switched to Murchie's of Canada,excellent quality teas, and now I tried Twinings again and am disappointed with it. It is acceptable, but not what I like in my teas."
398042,B000V17MLS,As good as any restaurant,Now only if I could get the Saag Paneer and Naan to go with it...
552645,B002AQKY9Y,Blueberries?,"No blueberries to be found, they use blueberry concentrate to create a skittle like nodule.  Not any blueberry flavor."
38,B001EO5QW8,it's oatmeal,"What else do you need to know? Oatmeal, instant (make it with a half cup of low-fat milk and add raisins;nuke for 90 seconds). More expensive than Kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tastier or better texture or something. It's still just oatmeal. Mmm, convenient!"
460882,B000FPGYSW,Geber Barley Cereal,the only reason I purchased this on amazon is because I could not find it in the stores and the pediatrician had recommended it for my infant grandson.  It does not disolve well and tends to clump up in the nipple.
201,B0028C44Z0,Altoids Smalls,"Even with small containers, they don't fill them up.  These little tins are less than half filled and at the price charged it seems a rip-off. Is there some exotic ingredient as costly as gold contained in those tiny squares?  Or how about the cereal ploy, they were filled at the factory but settled in transport.<br />Can manufacturers be honest in their dealings?"
484443,B00020HHGS,I drink this for arthritis pain...,...and something seems to be working! It could be this alfalfa tea which tastes just like...alfalfa tea. My aunt has pain too and does not like to be without this tea.
7805,B00474H936,Best Veggie burger mix I have tried!,"I have been a Vegetarian for about a year now, so I am relatively new to the meat substitute market.  But this is by far the best Veggie burger mix I have tried.  Far better then any of the frozen patties you can get in grocery stores.  An added bonus is the versatility of the mix.  You can use it for many different things instead of just being stuck with patty form like the frozen variety.  My meat eating girlfriend really likes this as well, and she tends to be pretty picky."
316996,B002PY3PPQ,Good formula,"I recommend this, the 10-15-10 formula seems to be what finally turned the corner on my house plants. They were yellow and nothing else would change that until this 10-15-10 came along."
1388,B00068PCTU,Great Taste and Zero Calories,"I have tried various brands of stevia, but I always come back to NuNaturals.  I buy the 12 ounce container because I use it to sweeten everything.  If you have a sweet tooth as I do but don't need the added pounds, then this is the ticket for you.  I drink a lot of tea, and this is my sweetener.  A lot of other stevia brands leave a bitter after taste, but this is the best that I have found to resolve that problem.  Highly recommended."
6612,B002BRC562,Excelent product !!,"Yo soy corredora, y he probado muchos tipos de productos, este es el que mejor resultado me ha dado."
57093,B003QU2LYY,Zero stars - this stuff is not good at ALL!!,No tea flavor at all.  Tastes like watered down lemonade.  I drink a lot of tea and this stuff is so bad that I am returning the opened box for a refund.
117416,B001AVK422,great farro resotto,Made this risotto with farro rather than rice using the standard method for a risotto.<br /><br />When the farro risotto was cooked we included chopped asparagas and fava beans. Everyone attending the dinner now looking for farro perlato.

77260,B000VK339Y,Life Saver,"My dog Annie has a health condition by the name of Megaesophagus,  anyone interested in learning about this can find information on the internet.  We had got to the point where we did not know what to feed her.<br /><br />Her regular dog food would get incapsulated in the slime, and she would vomit it all up including the slime. This food is high in protein and calories I add enough water to it and mix it well to where it passes through to her stomach.<br /><br />She has two meals a day  and thanks to finding this food I did not have to put her to sleep.  (Her condition had got that bad)"
81107,B000O9WEY2,I like oatmeal,"I got a 5lb bag of rolled oats from the farmer's market in Detroit.  Little did I know how hard it was to properly flavor blan oatmeal without adding 2lbs of sugar.  This solved my problem and makes my morning breakfast that much faster - boil, add, stir.  But why did they add like 6 packets of the plain stuff?  The cat won't even eat it."

30503,B004N2KOOI,great addition,"We've tried many kinds of olive oil products---for dipping, cooking, etc.---and this is a winner. The flavor is not overwhelming, but present, and it works as a dipping oil, as well as base on fish and poultry."

8138,B0019GVYR2,the item is great  shipping was not,This is a wonderful product...but it comes in a paper bag  which is easy to puncture and when you ship it in a box with no bubble wrap it slides around a lot and you start to get leakage of the product....powder everywhere.  I would order it again if I was sure it would be packaged right so it wouldn't be sliding around in the box.
1067,B0017ZBPTW,Perfect for Espresso,Love this for espressos...the raw sugar cube is not as sweet as the refined sugars and more rich in flavor.
8412,B003VXFK44,great taste,"this product is great tasting and you don't even need sugar or creamer, but if you like sweet coffee i'd say a little sugar and creamer would not hurt, this is a perfect product to wake up to every morning :)"

5171,B0002UDY9W,So yummy!,"I love tea, hot or cold, and am always looking to try new ones. This tea brews up a wonderful cup - just opening the bag to scoop some out is a joy. The smell alone is captivating. I tried a cup to relieve a stomach ache and it relieved my discomfort immediately. It really does taste just like good quality licorice and it's naturally sweet. When my urge for sweets hits, I can now reach for this tea instead and it really does satisfy my cravings. This tea will be a staple in my pantry."

43062,B002LFBA8S,Great for people with braces!,My 11 year old son recently got braces and was devastated when his orthodontist said no more popcorn.  We tried Lady Finger popcorn and it's small enough and soft enough that he can eat it with no problems.

45446,B003NC71FO,waste of money,"This product was definately a waste my money.  It certainly didn't taste like butter and had no buttery taste to it, which is what the claim is.  I guess that is why they have the six (6) pack purchase because they know this stuff isn's worth it.  Also, feel that they are trying to get rid of this stuff. If I could return this it would certainly be in the mail by now for a refund. terrible buttery popcorn topping.  If you have taste buds you will be dissappointed."

36525,B004CLCEDE,only downfall is the price.,"Well, when you buy a noodle made with yam flour, tofu, or something unconventional you cannot expect it to feel or taste like regular noodles.<br /><br />That being said, I knew what I was buying and I got what I expected. A chewy/gummy noodle, that can be used as a pasta substitute.<br /><br />It's filling, the noodles smell unpleasant when you first open the bag...but that goes away once rinsed and heated.<br /><br />I actually like these noodles. Quite tasty and versatile if prepared correctly (i.e. in soups, stir fried with garlic and veggies, etc)."
5137,B0028VAQSU,Gluten Free and feel good,"When you have health issues taking Gluten out of your diet is a good way to start, it may be the source of your problem, it has been in my case, and using Pamela's Products has helped me get on the right track to feeling better."

31309,B0017D070M,Disappointed,"For around $9, I recieved a small box of 8 crickets. I figured it would be like a delicacy, but upon popping one into my mouth- an overpowering vinegar taste along with an undesireably crunchy/non-dissolving texture(like eating a popcorn seed with vinegar powder) forced me to promptly spit it out. Disgusting, and a huge waste of money."
132945,B0090X8IPM,Just not enough flavor,"I tried this just to see if it lived up to the Starbucks name. The flavor just wasn't there. It has some vanilla flavor but not what i would expect from this brand of coffee. I think I will stick to my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2RC"">Torani Sugar-Free Syrup, Vanilla, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a> added to regular coffee. Then I can adjust the taste to my mood."

586,B000G6RYNE,Spicy Thai,"When I saw the Spicy Thai chips, I knew i had to try them. I love spicy and I love Thai food, so why not? First off, these chips are not super spicy. They actually taste sort of sweet at first, with many degrees of flavor. The spiciness is more of a lingering taste that bites afterwards. I'd say these are definitely a good, unique chip. But if you absolutely hate sweet chips, I'd try a different flavor since these are a little sweet."
3191,B000FDKUSO,best snack,"Susie's thin cakes are a great snack if you are trying to lose weight or just eat healthy. I bought the one that is sodium, cholesterol, fat and sugar free. For three cakes it is only 54 calories, so you can add a toppin like taboule or your favorite topping without the guilt. They are very tasty. The only problem is the availability of the product. I am on a waiting list with Amazon for this product."
5678,B000H23YC2,Queen of Gravies!,"Absolutely amazing! This gravy wins over any other hands down for that good ole down home country taste!<br /><br />My neighbor & I frequently eat meals together. Yesterday I slow-cooked pork chops in about 3 cups of water, with diced potatoes, onion, pepper, frozen speckled butter beans, & parsley, sage & a can of cream of chicken soup for seasoning. She made mashed potatoes & after removing the pork chops, added a pack of this gravy mix to the sauce right in with the beans & diced potatoes for a lovely rich gravy. I don't recall a meal like it since my grandmother's house! We saved the leftover gravy, and tonight we're cooking chicken & corn to serve with it!<br /><br />I now have this saved so we can keep ourselves in gravy heaven! Thank you Amazon.com for carrying this & Southeastern Mills for a quality, reasonably priced, fantastic gravy!"

2172,B000N5XCPM,CAUTION/DENTED CANS,"I have a special needs pet and searched for the right food.  Since Amazon has been a five star resource I chose to have Pot Pie shipped. Many of the cans are dented.  So I have to toss them or return. This is a big hassle but would not ever feed a dented can to my beloved boy.  Best to purchase at the pet store, evidently."

386,B001ESOQAM,Good for the money,"The cashews were nice and big, with the vast majority being whole.  There were a number of small pieces at the bottom of the bag, but that's pretty expected with so many cashews.  They made an absolutely excellent cashew brittle.<br /><br />My order took just over a week to arrive, which was pretty decent considering it was shipped across the country.  They came double bagged in clear plastic bags, and in two 5 lb portions.  This was highly convenient since I could just throw one of the bags into the freezer until I was ready to work with it.<br /><br />Great value for the price."
290,B001UJEN6C,Great Energy,I bought these for my husband and he said they are the best energy shots out there. He takes one in the mornings and works hard all day. Good stuff!

8577,B003VXFK44,OK,I thought the coffee tasted fine.  It was not strong enough for my husband.  Several of the pods burst during brewing.  I probably won't purchase this again.
73256,B003SOHKIA,AMAZING PRODUCT!,My pet has to take medication throughout the day and this is a fool proof way do dispense it. Before I purchased I would try in hide his meds in his treats.
7193,B001EO5YHK,Hot,"Well, at least they live up to their name. These nuts are definitely hot, too bad that's all the positive I have to say about them. Other than that, they taste like cardboard, and not very good cardboard either."
15806,B007TJGZ5E,Not the good stuff!,"These were awful!  I have had these many time s before but this box was below par and gives both me and my husband strong heartburn.

36583,B004CLCEDE,not gross but can't get over the texture,"This wasn't entirely disgusting.. The flavor itself wasn't too bad, it soaked in the flavor of the stir fry.  However, I just cannot get over the texture.  I kept feeling like I was eating hookworms since they were long, clear and rubbery. *shudder*  Won't be able to eat the other bags."
346319,B00141SO7A,Healthy and good for your dog,My dog loves the taste of these treats.  They have glucosamine in them which is why i tried them.  He can't get enough of them.
4879,B002C56OBU,"We Like It, You Will Too.","We first discovered Community Coffee while on a visit to Lake Charles, LA. And until recently it was only available in LA or by mail.

We like it and have a standing order with Amazon to have it shipped to us at convenient intervals."
180,B005CJVVJ8,"relaxing, almost like something you smoke","Couldn't believe it when told how relaxing this beverage was. Seriously, drink it only if you are getting ready for a nap or bedtime. If you have plans to drive or perform any other activity not recommended.<br /><br />I feel my arms and legs almost tingle with relaxation. After a short time my eyes start to get droopy and I am in another place.<br /><br />Love this stuff."
45722,B0041NYV8E,Medicinal Tasting,"I'm sorry, I just didn't like this. It tastes like medicine and nobody likes drinking medicine when they don't have too. The ginger tastes is way overpowering, almost like drinking gingersnap cookies and I don't mean that in a good way."
400907,B0016PC4TS,Did the job,"We had a problem with chipmunks in our yard.  My husband sprinkled this all around the foundation of our house, and we haven't seen a chipmunk since then.  We would definitely buy it again."
47981,B004SRH2B6,Very Disappointed,"I based my purchase entirely upon user feedback.  It may be the packaging (non-hermetic) that is impacting the taste, but this product was simply bland.  I reviewed the ingredients and is is reconstituted.  Perhaps coconut looses flavor during the dehydration process.  Nonetheless, I will struggle through the remaining 10 bottles and cancel my Amazon subscription for it.  Off to the next brand..."

3119,B004JQVASM,"A Good News, Bad News Situation for Low-Acid Drinkers","A short while ago, my doctor looked me in the eye and said, ""Buddy, you got acid reflux real bad.""  (My dentist said the same - only he was able to make his announcement a bit more colorful by showing `worst case scenario' pictures of teeth on battery acid. He put me off coffee for a week.)  So, with that double-whammy in mind, I've lately been trying to cut back on acidic foods.  Hence my decision to go the low-acid coffee route.<br /><br />And like the headline says, this coffee is a good news bad news situation.<br /><br />First, the good news: Puroast Coffee does in fact appear to be legitimately low-acid.  I've noticed a distinct reduction in acid reflux activity after drinking it.<br /><br />Now, the bad news: this coffee is kinda bad.  I should note, this isn't the opinion of a coffee snob:  while I like a good cup of Peet's Coffee as much as the next guy, I'm a-okay with a batch of Folger's or the basic house brand of whatever chain store I happen to be shopping in.  I'm usually just looking for a pleasant kick start in the morning at a price that isn't highway robbery.<br /><br />Alas, for all of its low acidity (and decent price), this coffee ain't that pleasant kick start.  There's an unpleasant flavor to it that is rather hard to describe - other than to say that Puroast doesn't really taste like French Roast coffee.  Even doctored up with cinnamon and milk, the unpleasant flavor remains.<br /><br />So yes, this coffee is effective, if you absolutely need to have coffee.  But if you're looking for a pleasant, low acid kick start to your day, black tea might be a better, tastier option."

I saw the Grove Square brand and thought I would give it a try since I got 36 kcups for less than the 24 from Keurig. I received my purchase yesterday and immediately opened it up to try it.  The cocoa actually has sugar in it and the chocolately flavor is much better than the Cafe Escapes. I will be ordering this one again, and I hope my guest will drink the other kind to get rid of it!"

Since August we've tried about 5 different allergy-friendly bars, these are the only ones she'll eat-after she took one bite she gave me a big hug.

41473,B00141QYSQ,My dogs love 'em: update re dog sickness /made in China. Amazon should stop selling.,Updating my prior review from  2009 as my dog was very sick with a mystery illness last year with enlarged liver and kidney issues.  I was heartsick as he was so ill.  I spent several thousand dollars on vet care and testing.  It never dawned on me it could have been these chews -- I just realized that they were made in China and the brand is listed as one of those implicated according to this month's Whole Dog Journal.  Amazon should stop selling These until the manufacturer stops using their China plant.
1146,B001ELL7JM,Non Alcoholic..,"This stuff is great if you're looking for a non-alcoholic vanilla extract...yes this is really a vanilla extract not just a flavor like the essence stuff. I read somewhere on the net that the only reason they can't call it an extract is because it wasn't extracted by alcohol so legally they have to call it a flavor.<br />The smell and color are gorgeous plus its fair trade certified, the texture is a little bit like honey, I think it's the glycerin.<br /><br />Going to buy again for sure."
592,B000G6RYNE,Pretty tasty and decently spiced. . . .,"My son bought a package of the Jalapeno Potato Chips a couple weeks ago, and he and I have become addicted.<br /><br />First, Kettle chips appear to be somewhat better in terms of fats etc. than many other chips, as one peruses the dietary information.<br /><br />Second, individual chips are nice and crisp and have a good crunch value as you munch away at them.<br /><br />Third, the jalapeno has some kick (not overly hot, of course). Too many products labelled as spicy are not, have no kick, and are as bland as can be. Here, you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno. My preference? A bit more heat. But I understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than I would. Still, decent spicyness.<br /><br />All in all, I have been pretty happy with this product, in the few weeks since we first bought it. I now purchase a package each week in my foray to the local grocery store. . . ."

I knew with the first bite that the crackers now had an unpleasant ""twang"" in the taste.  I gave some to the rest of my family not telling them about the awful taste. They ate them without hesitation since they had enjoyed them in the past.  As soon as it hit their taste buds, they said, ""YUK!""<br /><br />When checking out the ingredients, to find out what had happened to these crackers, I found the sunflower addition.  Unfortunately, besides the bad taste, I am allergic to sunflower products, so will no longer purchase them.<br /><br />I wrote to the company asking that they return to the original recipe, but never received a reply."
313062,B000EZMRP2,Good Ahi tuna jerky,"This product was delivered as promised and quite tasty. Not too fishy, as some types of fish jerky can be."
32733,B0083QJU72,Not so tasty,After costco ran out of grade a thought I would try this. There is no comparing the grade A with this stuff. If you are looking to replace grade a look elsewhere.
34876,B0013XLNSG,Not the Le Gout Chicken Base you may be looking for,"I ordered this product thinking it was the Le Gout Chicken Base I love so much. When I got it, the first thing I noticed was the color was a bright mustard-yellow instead of the darker-colored one I was used to. Comparing the labels on the bottles, I then realized this was a ""chicken flavor base"" instead of ""chicken base"". Comparing the ingredients, you can see that chicken is not even listed as an ingredient, only chicken fat. Since this is a grocery item it cannot be returned. My mistake, just don't want anyone else to make the same one I did."
5835,B000FL0A9A,No coffee flavor / high calorie count,"I really wanted a decaf product so didn't have a lot of options. This powder essentially makes a chocolate flavored blended drink, even when I use cold decaf coffee or espresso as the ""base"", the chocolate is what you taste. When I think of an iced coffee drink, I think of coffee with a hint of chocolate (mocha) not the other way around.<br /><br />As other reviewers point out, the 150 calories is for half the packet and no milk added.<br /><br />I will try a different brand next time. I'm still on the hunt for a mix that creates the same flavor I've experienced once in a great while at a coffee shop. Or like the iced blended at a west coast chain (CB&TL) that is overpriced to have shipped (and I think is available sugar free)!"
206248,B000GG0BLQ,Reasonable Price,Can you imagine having to pay $5.40 for 20 bags? This is a deal !!
2851,B0085G4ACA,Yummy,Love the pineapple flavor. Makes me feel like I am on vacation drinking a pina colada. (You probably could add a little rum and.....)Really tastes better than other pineapple coconut waters I have tried!!
174331,B000VKADQK,Happy Dog,My dog LOVES this food. He follows us around at meal time till he gets his food and then never leaves his dish till it's gone.
6910,B001LG945O,Good for sipping - a LOT of sugar!,"It has a nice taste.  Good for sipping.  If you drink soda or juice with your meals, this would be a decent alternative.  The tangerine taste is pronounced but not overpowering.  The carbonation is pleasant.<br /><br />However, it's not a drink I would normally imbibe.  I normally drink either water or beverages sweetened with something other than sugar.  And this has a LOAD of sugar.  Yes, they say it has no added sugar.  That's probably accurate.  But the natural sugar in the apple/tangerine/orange juices in this drink adds up to 34 grams.  Compare that to the same amount of Coke at 27 grams!  I checked a few other tangerine flavored sodas - they all had similar amounts of sugar as Switch.  I suppose tangerines are loaded with sugar.  Anyway, that's a lot more sugar than I normally drink.<br /><br />If the sugar isn't an issue, this is worth checking out."
501423,B0039OVW74,Melted,I sent this to someone as a gift and the contents were melted and clumped together. The package was not sitting outside. Please improve your packaging.
37787,B000LKVDO6,dont like the taste,I am not a big fan of pav bhaji but this tastes worse of all the pav bhajis I ate
2224,B002C4HZ00,You don't get what you order,"You order (and pay for)D.O.P. Certified San Marzano tomatoes but you will receive ""CERTIFIED"" which means absolutely nothing. A true SM tomato will have an EU D.O.P emblem on the label plus the Corsorzio San Marzano stamp. This is false advertising.  If you enlarge the picture shown you can see on the upper left side partially one of the stamps. You will not receive this DOP label.  You will  receive another tomato from somewhere in the region under the Cento name. Typical marketing hoodwinking. Amazon refuses to take returns on this item, so beware."
18782,B001534R00,"jittery, shaking stimulant feel","This was not a good drink! I drank half of a can. After 30 minutes my hands were shaking out of control and my heart rate was elevated. I felt I had to get up and exercise so I wouldn't feel terrible, not because I had more energy. I didn't feel hungry and I had to pee every few minutes. I can't imagine what would have happened if I drank the whole can. I might as well have taken some crazy illegal substance, because the experience was not good!"
3455,B005K4Q1VI,Cocoa wasn't bad. . .Price was horrible,The Cocoa wasn't too bad. The taste is ok and as good as other hot chocolate mixes.  I was disappointed though when I went to a local store and saw it for less than what I paid just for shipping.  I really thought I was getting a good deal until I went home and checked the ticket.  I just paid three times as much for a box of hot chocolate to be delivered to my house! SO DISAPPPOINTED!!:(
357890,B001GCTTRQ,I drink this for arthritis pain...,...and something seems to be working! It could be this alfalfa tea which tastes just like...alfalfa tea. My aunt has pain too and does not like to be without this tea.
4075,B001EW5YQS,Works great!,Great USB audio interface! I also own the Shure X2U and they perform just about the same...I wish I would have known that before I spent way more on the X2U.
69480,B001ET5Y5C,Not how orange pekoe should be,I usually drink Brooke Bond Taj Mahal and I decided to try it since it was on sale at the local Indian grocery store. My mistake. It has an oily smell and the taste is flat. Never buying this again. I drank about 20 bags and then couldn't take anymore. Tossed the lot.
74677,B0026RQTGE,My Dog Says YUMMMMM,"My Chihuahua has horrible horrible breath.... and she loves to get in your face and give kisses to everyone. These help, and she loves to eat them. Good thing she can't reach the counter!"
80950,B005HGAV92,Horrible!!,I ignored the reviews because I figured it would not be that bad. Was I ever wrong. Very disappointed in the horrible selection. Not even one iced tea. Not one. And half of the regular tea was Green Tea. What a joke. Do yourself a favor and just move on. I wish I did.<br /><br />Amazon you should be ashamed of this product. You need to seriously consider how this process works.
409504,B001ELL67A,Coffee Is OK - Amazons Price Is Poor,Amazon has increased all Kcup prices by 21% for some reason. It was $23 and now jumped to 27.90 for some reason. All brands were increased the same so it wasn't the manufacturer. You can still get them for $.53 a cup at coffeeforless.com. Amazon is no longer the cheapest.
62610,B000OYKC1O,LIFESAVERS 5 FLAVOR HARD CANDY,"Shouldn't buy it...too tempting and not good for the teeth! But it's hard to resist....tasting item...tasting item, tasting item, tasting, tasting item!"
26916,B004NDV46E,Great Product,I use this product daily and it has significantly helped me in reducing the occurrence of the commom cold. Will continue to buy this product and recommend EmergenC.
24913,B0078Y6OX8,Good but not great.,This selection was somewhat of a disappointment. The taste was good but it could have been a little stronger to suit me. The flavor is just a little too subtle.
1858,B001RVFDOO,"Love, love, love these chips!!","Wow, these chips are delicious!<br /><br />They're low in calorie and carb count. I can actually have a salty snack without feeling guilty about it and the taste is better then unhealthy oil-smothered grocery store chips.<br /><br />The sour cream & onion, salt & vinegar, and cheddar are my favorites!<br /><br />If you're weight conscience, want something healthy, or just want something that tastes good, buy these chips! You won't be disappointed!"
10975,B001BIXK7K,Definitely the FINAL answer (for now),"I started with tabasco sauce at age 5, worked my way to jalapenos in my teens, then habaneros, and finally the ghost chili in my 20s. I am always on the hunt for the next HOTTEST sauce as i keep killing my taste buds on this stuff. The last sauce I rolled the dice on was the Dave's Ghost Pepper sauce and it was fantastic. I thought ghost peppers would be the hottest thing until I got my hands on this little tiny bottle called Da Bomb - The Final Answer. Hmmmm... made from Habaneros and pepper extract? It couldn't be too bad I thought. Like a champ I put a dime sized blob on a chip and tossed it in my mouth. After a few chews my parents asked me ""Well how is it?"" I tried to talk and realized once this bad boy goes aerosol or you breathe it you're done. ""It's goo.... *cough* *cough*"" My eyes began to water and the heat took over. This stuff is not a joke, not a game. Over the past year my mouth and tongue has become desensitized to it and I can eat it no problem but the intestines never lie. It feels like the devil himself is laughing while he crawls through your colon, clawing you from within. Do NOT attempt to eat this on an empty stomach. In a pathetic attempt to show off to co-workers I brought it to work and we all tried some before lunch. After a few minutes I felt as if a fiery ulcer had erupted and had to chug about 3 Sodas before it subsided. This is the hottest stuff i've found to date... yet i'm still on the hunt. Use at your own... misguided risk."
281433,B004FHDPM4,not MADE in America,"Despite the fact that Ranch Rewards makes it LOOK like their products are made in America, they are in fact made in China.  It seems they are made using American products but processed overseas.  Don't be fooled like I was."
715,B000G6MBX2,Best tortilla chips ever!!!,We like these chips for salsa and quacomole better than any other cips on the market. They are even great by themselves. We will order these as long as they are available. Thank you for making them accessable.<br /><br />  Shelly Kenyon
72590,B004X3VRLG,Pretty big to be called Mini,"My dog is a bit of a picky eater and she will eat these but definitely prefers other bones over these.<br /><br />There are 7 bones per pack and each bone is fairly large (especially since she's a 16 pound terrier).  It looks like a cannoli with the rawhide wrap on the outside and bone / peanut butter flavor on the inside. The whole thing is quite hard, I suppose to provide maximum chewing time and teeth cleaning.<br /><br />I haven't noticed whether it actually has helped her digestion as she doesn't usually have problems.  *shrugs*"
816,B004ET7MG8,Great Gum,I love this flavor and I cant find it on the shelves anymore. The gum tasted fresh which is actually way better than when I used to buy it in stores!
4199,B004391DK0,Not for Pancakes,"I love pancakes, so giving up gluten was hard for me.  I've used Bisquick for pancakes for years with great results.  Alas, the best I got from the Gluten-Free version was edible, but not enjoyable.  It tasted a lot like pillow foam, not in a good way.  I will probably keep the mix for breading things, but not for pancakes.  I've found much better options."
16837,B001LGGH40,Tastes like a cheap lollipop.,"What is supposed to be the purpose of this soda? ""100% juice""--but not 100% of what's on the front of the label. Kiwi, raspberry, and strawberry juice concentrates are lesser ingredients; apple and grape juice are in the majority. And so what if it has 100% of the RDA of Vitamin C. So do a lot of other things. Is it possible to OD on vitamin C?<br /><br />The bottom line, though, is no matter what the combination of juices is, it tastes like cheap candy. Not pleasant at all."
2202,B000LRKO9E,Great Find!,"I have two recipes I'm anxious to try that call for pomegranate molasses. I've called all the specialty and best markets in the Sacramento area and no one's heard of this, much less carries it.  It's common in Mediterranean recipes, goes with shrimp, fish, chicken, beef and pork. I was delighted to find it on Amazon and look forward to using mine in a fabulous short ribs recipe.  I'm also passing along the info to my friends so they can order their own -- or I may give as gifts to my gourmet cook friends."
191057,B006W5WBUO,Yummy,Apple jacks. Where can you go wrong? My kids and husband love them. Even my toddler asks for them for breakfast.
63483,B002IEZJMA,The worst thing I've ever tasted,"1. I am purposely writing this review blind of the other reviews.  If I am the only 1 star then consider I must have got a bad can.  That or &lt;1% of the population has a gene incompatible with this recipe :-)<br /><br />2. Is ""worst thing"" hyperbolic.. maybe.  I remember when I was five I tried tasting some strawberry air freshener, that was pretty bad.  Among intended foodstuffs, this does indeed rank up there with worst<br /><br />3. The ingredients are coffee, sugar, and preservative, so I am not sure how it has gone wrong.  For one thing it tastes slightly carbonated/citric... likely the preservative.  And the sweetness is just way off.  Too high and totally unbalanced with the coffee.  The coffee has a weird mouth-feel.  Ever accidentally sipped form a cup of coffee on your desk only to realize it was from 3 days ago?  Sort of like that.<br /><br />If it helpful to know, I am a coffee drinker.  My general drinks of choice are double-short-americano or triple-tall-cappucino"
59502,B0045TK3PO,"Gas, bloating and other problems after eating","I bought this as an alternative to the regular version of Pillsbury cake mixes and while it tasted fine, I did suffer from horrible gas and stomach pains.  I ate only the recommended amount, but the problems last a couple of days.  I am not saying this will happen to everyone who tries this product, but my husband and myself won't dare eat this cake, nor the sugar-free frosting again!"
73592,B003YT3434,great product,This is a great sampler that came promptly as stated by the vendor. I was disappointed to find out the company is essentially for fund raisers so I'm not able to order from them again.
5421,B00622CYVS,Just okay.,"Our pediatrician told me to include some form of meat at dinner for our baby. Unfortunately, two of the four varieties don't include meat. I don't think Summer Vegetable should be included in a dinner variety pack, that's what the vegetable variety pack is for. Also, the chicken and sweet potato is extremely runny and hard to feed to a baby."
2131,B004ET9OIW,"Great in a pinch...portable, healthy","While I worry that I am teaching my baby to be a snacker, these are perfect for the in-between times for my 1 year old grazer. The label tells me that they are a healthier choice for my baby than the typical grocery store aisle alternative. I like to keep these in the car and diaper bag for helping to calm my little one while waiting for meal, etc. I don't think they taste awesome, but he sure eats them like they are going to disappear. That makes me happy!"
187655,B0001GZ6C0,Give Instant or Regular Coffee a Gourmet Flavor Boost,Flavor Creations tablets add a gourmet boost to the flavor of regular and instant coffee.
19481,B000PCC3KI,Wonderful treat,My cats go crazy for this treat. This is the only cat or dog treat they will eat. They all mob me in the kitchen every morning and evening. My dog loves it too and will try to get it from the cats if I don't catch him first.
8441,B003VXFK44,Makes you feel like you are having breakfast in bed.,Have enjoyed every single cup of Breakfast in Bed. Just the right kind of brew to wake up these old bones and get me started on the day's adventure. Also enjoy it while watching NCIS so I can join Gibbs enjoying a brew as well.
52686,B0017T2MWW,Made in Thailand! Not the original!,"I have been receiving this product for almost a year as a subscribe and save deal. Up until a few months ago Amazon sent the real, original thing. This is unfortunately no longer the case! If you order this you will get Ito En Oi Ocha, yes...but it's made in Thailand and comes in a really weak, pathetic bottle. Ito En HAS NOT changed their suppliers or changed their factory locations completely to Thailand. They still manufacture this product in Japan. Amazon has simply decided to buy the cheaper Thai version of the product, likely due to the strength of the Yen...but I would still gladly pay more to get the original thing...<br /><br />As far as the flavor goes, the Thai version tastes a different, likely due to the taste difference of Thai water vs. Japanese water. You cannot tell if it is VERY cold...but if it is above fridge temperature you can definitely taste (*and even smell!*) a difference.<br /><br />Amazon's image for the product is WRONG. That is not the product you will receive.<br /><br />Unless you have no other options to get this product DO NOT BUY IT until Amazon understands that sourcing ""Japanese"" green tea from Thailand is wrong and an insult to their customers."
198958,B000OQ2DJQ,Game Changer,You are reading the review for a reason. The reviews speak for themselves. This stuff is second to none. Buy it. End of story.
71,B001GVISJC,Great Gummi!,"These Albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality. The bears even have little faces. At my local candy store this type of gummi stuff (bears, rings, snakes, balls, worms, whatever) are about $10/lb. These twin packs of 4.5 or 5 pound bags is a screaming deal as far as I'm concerned. I'm probably 50 pounds deep in these friggin' things. Consumed!"
182721,B002STPN9E,not an assortment,The box contained 2 marvel characters Thor and Captain American I was expecting an assortment like what was shown in the picture.
57,B004N5KULM,Awesome Deal!,Deal was awesome!  Arrived before Halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters.  I love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local store's candy.
36496,B004CLCEDE,Mixed Family Reviews,"My grandchildren and I tried the pasta as my youngest GS is on a carb restricted diet. I found the noodles to have an extremely unpleasant odor when I opened the package. I found it ""fishy"" and so strong as to give me difficulty cooking them. I am not able to tolerate fish odor well. However,my grandchildren did not remark on the odor at all. The taste was masked by the tomato meat sauce that I used and both of them ate it eagerly. They are much more expensive than regular pasta.  The entire package made small servings for the 3 of us, far less pasta than an equal weight of dried pasta would provide. We will use this up, but I doubt that I will buy again."
1377,B00068PCTU,best tasting stevia,This is the best tasting stevia powder I've tried. Most other powders have a weird after taste but this one doesn't. I recently bought a 5lb bag of it online and I'm making my way through it.
560025,B0030GNQMU,Overpriced,I have written to this company to try to get an answer as to why I was overcharged for this coffee.<br />I do not recommend buying this product until Liquid Nation is NOT ALLOWED to sell it.
102518,B001AG68BI,Love Licorice,If you are a licorice lover this tea will be a special<br /><br />treat without all the calories.
31778,B002HQEYUC,Sick!,"This stuff is the most vile, disgusting stuff I've ever tried. It's so wrong on so many levels. The texture is odd, the taste is odd, and nothing could salvage it. SICK SICK SICK!!!"
408610,B000FDDET6,Perfect loaf every time.,I hestitate to buy the bread mixes in the store as I never can count on their loaf integrity. I have no hesitation in putting in a loaf of this in my machine before company comes and counting on it to turn out every time. The smell is divine and I get rave reviews on the taste. Nothing beats homemade!
6483,B000FNEX50,great snack,"My 9 year old daughter has celiac disease, and these are one of her favorite cookies (other than the ones I make!)  They are a great quick snack for her to bring and have on hand so that she DOESN'T feel left out or deprived when cookies are offered to kids in social situations."
64243,B000KKQNJM,RIP OFF - Shipping and Handling $14.79,"Total rip off.  The shipping and handling for this was $14.79!!! Total price was over $30 dollars. I am so glad I didn't do ""one click ordering"" on this item.  They low balled the price and almost double it with outrageous shipping and handling charges.  I will never do business with this company again."
45440,B003AUWZUK,TOO Salty!,"I baought these at my local Rite AId store on sale. These are the saltiest and worst chips I have every had!  Awful, will  never buy these again! I like the barbecue ones but not these!"
433470,B001FZ0T2S,love that these are yogurt flavor!  my dog loves booda bones!,I have no problem w/my dog eating these.  He loves these booda bones. I had never seen the yogurt ones; he loves them.
68832,B000H7ELTM,"Small berries, way to much oil used to prevent caking.","I have been eating dried blueberries for years.  I mostly buy them from the grocer in smaller portion bags.  I thought I was getting a deal buying these.<br /><br />The blue berries in this pack are very small, yes blue berries are small berries but the berries used by Traverse are extremely small compared to other brands.  The size of the berries was not my main issue with the content of the package I bought.  All berries come with a small amount of oil added to prevent caking.  Traverse uses way to much oil to the point where the flavor of the berries is effected by it.<br /><br />These berries did not taste like the blue berries I had purchased before, all I could taste was the oil.  The berries resembled and tatsed like dried and oiled olives except much smaller.  I did not enjoy them and if I did not toss out the packaging I would of returned them.<br /><br />I would recommend going with a different brand, if not then buy the smaller package first as so you can make sure you like them before spending $50+ dollars on the larger package such as this one."
817,B004ET7MG8,Delicious IMO and.... helps weight loss,"If some other yahoo deems it ok to give give a suck review to this stuff because he doesn't like the taste, I feel I must assert that in this -as in all matters of taste- ""De Gustibus Non Disputandem Est"".<br /><br />I really love this gum. OK it doesn't really taste like strawberry, but it's still delicious. It has a wonderfully smooth consistency about halfway through, but then it gets tired, stuff, and squeaky.<br /><br />You'll forgive the squeaks perhaps when you find, as I did, that this stuff is a wonderful dietetic aid. By obsessively chewing this product I filled my gut with odorless room air and so helped me lose 25# in 3 months.<br /><br />Also, it doesn't lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight."
10111,B003EML8PM,Totally wonderful if not overcooked,"Unlike microwave popcorn, you cannot hear the pork skins cooking, so only by trial and error and the wattage of your microwave will you know how long to cook these. Cooked to the proper timing, they will be fluffy, melt in you mouth. 15 seconds too long you will have a stinky unedible product.<br />It is something that you must try. I cooked mine for 1 minute 45 seconds and they were not all done. I do not know the wattage of my microwave.<br />So try them for your self. As I said, they are different than popcorn, but have the same results if left too long in the micowave, stinky."
31906,B0062A87HA,Sometimes dented,I have purchased this item before.  Once they were all dented and once they were not.  I would bet that if they run out of their dented product they are clearing out then they ship the undented ones.
457648,B003ZUNVOE,Item not yet received,"Dear Sirs,<br /><br />I have not yet received this item!!!!!! I have placed the order back in April 2012 and till now, 12 June 2012 nothign has been received"

96871,B003WK0D8O,Meow!,What can I say...this is the only brand of food my cat will eat. She tears into the bag by chewing on it as soon as I get it. I have to pour in into a plastic container. It also controls hair balls.
290355,B000NMCOYK,Very Very Slow,You have got to be kidding me!  Over three weeks to get a tub of bubble gum shipped to Pennsylvania.  Next time I will order from Belgium.  Then I might get the product prior to Christmas.
7491,B000143ZK2,"Totally satisfying, healthy snack","Granda Po's are the perfect snack when you crave something crunchy and delicious.  They are also very healthy so you can enjoy them guilt-free.  I love all the flavors.  My son begs me for them, so now he's a fan too.  I even shipped them to my brother's platoon in Iraq.  Everyone loved them!"
6465,B000FNEX50,"great for restricted diets, kids like",I have a 7 yr old w/food allergies and both he and my 3 yr old love these.  I have compared to several other cookie/snack items made with no dairy & eggs and I think we all liked these the best.  Definitely a must have for restricted diets.
491446,B000WL58J0,Candy,No problems with this transaction in any way.<br />All went without a hitch and the product was just as listed.
519856,B0041RVRUA,Struck Out,"I'm trying to find coffee I can order over the internet for a reasonable price.  The cost for shipping is usually the problem, so added it on to another order to get it shipped free.  The other order came in good time.  It took the coffee close to a month before it arrived.  It tasted like it'd been sitting in a warehouse the whole time; definitely not fresh.  The roast was also not dark enough for espresso.  Poor delivery, poor product.  This was not my usual Amazon experience."
901,B000ER6YO0,Dessert to Them.  But is it Nutritional Enough?,"My twin 10-month old babies treat this one as dessert.  Their first Earth's Best jar they loved was straight sweet potatoes.  After water, sweet potatoes are the first ingredient in this one, followed by apricot puree.  That's dessert for them right there.  After that comes the chicken and then brown rice flour (not as good as brown rice though).<br /><br />This is a meal that babies around the age of mine are probably almost all going to love instantly.  Almost all babies love sweet potatoes for starters.  Add apricot puree and there's really not much one could do to discourage babies after that.  I recommend this flavor brand.<br /><br />Ingredients per label: Water, organic sweet potatoes, organic apricot puree, mechanically separated organic chicken, organic brown rice flour.<br /><br />The rice flour absorbed the water and gave it a real nice consistency, and the sweet potatoes gave it a nice color.<br /><br />Nutrition per label: 80 calories, 15% protein, 90% vitamin A, 2% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 6% iron.<br /><br />This one had the most vitamin A of all Earth's Best jars I've tried.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult."
171375,B000WFORH0,Onslow Says Yuck,My cat wouldn't touch this stuff. I wound up giving it to the ASPCA.
303441,B0002AQ2WI,Dg chews,Our dog loves these sorry do t know how they taste but she likes them. Have more just hope it also helps her teeth.
207473,B003D4IYSU,yuk,I bought this tea for the health benefits but couldn't stand the taste.  I couldn't drink it.  Had to give it away and won't buy it again.
5936,B001O2IX8E,mine was also improperly sealed,I also ordered a flat of food (they were on sale) that contained The Turkey and Wild Rice Dinner.  One of them was also improperly sealed; the lid popped.  We were lucky because I just happened to check that one.  Now I'm so paranoid that I check all of them several times.  I called Earth's Best and they assured me that they haven't had this problem before and that I shouldn't worry about it.  I'm so suprised that this got passed QA/QC inspection at a baby food manufacturer.  Why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety?!
411,B0089PI9OC,Excellent tea!,"This tea tastes almost as good as the tea you would get at an Indian restaurant. It's much better than getting a teabag and making it the English way, with a lot of water and a bit of milk. This is very creamy and tasty. My only criticism is that there aren't enough sachets in the box. Only 10. Since the directions say that you use one sachet for 100ml of water (approximately half a cup), it's not enough for a good cup of tea, so I use two. That means that one box is only good enough for five cups of tea. But it's a delicious after-dinner drink! I would buy this again if there were more sachets in a box."
297591,B00141OX52,Drat!,I wish I had read that these are made in China before I bought them.  They are going in the trash - lesson learned.
374523,B003KRESRQ,Improper Packaging,"While the hot sauce smelled hot I never got to try it because the company that sent it out just threw it in a box and shipped it, No bubble wrap, no peanuts, not even those plastic balloons linked together just a bottle in a box. Needless to say the bottle broke in shipping and I never got to try it."
3859,B001M074MY,Best home-brewed coffee on the planet!,"We love Melitta coffee pods.  Makes a perfect cup of coffee every time. The coffee is always delicious, even the decaf blend!  If you have a coffee pod machine, try all of their blends...they're great!"
70119,B007I7Z3Z0,Deceptive advertising- will not purchase again,"When I read the description, it said it was sweetened with honey. I didn't realize that just because it says on the box that it's sweetened with honey, doesn't mean it isn't sweetened with an artificial sweetener also! The company is clearly trying to mislead consumers by pretending it's somehow ""natural"" because it's sweetened with honey and doesn't contain aspartame, but the truth is that it has sucralose. I personally do not like consuming artificial sweeteners and I think it is ridiculous that this company is trying to mislead consumers."
258915,B001QTN650,Fantastic for anyone from the UK,Having moved to the USA a couple of years ago I missed my Branston Pickle and cheese sandwiches. Amazon has come to the rescue and I've bought the 6 pack. If you like Branston Pickle then you'll find this is a must have!
282977,B0043BH1EK,NOT what is pictured!,Beware that this product is NOT what is pictured!  What is shown is the Pill Pockets for Capsules in a 7.9 oz bag.  What is delivered is the much smaller Pill Pockets for Tablets in a 3.2 oz bag.
1533,B000KM7DVC,Love it!!,"I brought 2 bottles.  One I carry in my pocket and the other for home.  I fell in love with this while on vacation in Belize.  Just a couple drops does the trick.  Packs a ton of flavor, but not too hot that it overpowers your food."
6571,B003AYL9NU,Get Naked Doggie Dental Sticks....,These Dental Sticks are perfect for my two dogs that have food allergies and they LOVE them and i like the price for them here at Amazon.
72945,B002CZNCPG,Veterinarian review,"I received a free sample of the Liv-a-Littles Healthsome dog biscuits with real chicken. This small biscuit, which you can see visible rolled oats in, prides itself on being oven-baked, with high-quality natural ingredients. Unfortunately, JP - my 11 year old picky pit bull - took it from my hand like a kid forced to swallow an oatmeal vitamin coated with vegetables. He eventually ate it, but it lacked the palability to please my dog.<br /><br />The ingredients include (in order): whole wheat flour, chicken, potato flour, pea flour, chicken liver, rolled oats, chicken fat (preserved with natural mixed tocopherols), pumpkin, tomatoes, apples, sweet potatoes, cranberries, split peas, carrots, green beans, green bell pepper, celery, parsley, and ascorbic acid (a preservative - Vitamin C). While it has all the healthy veggies in it that your mom would be proud of, it failed the Lee palatability test. One paw down for palatability. Of course, if you own a Labrador retriever who'll eat anything, he'll like them, but they didn't pass JP's palate."
17801,B000EVMNO6,"No flavor for Apples, just something sweet!","This product have no flavor at all, I could not taste apple or any other! It was just something sweet. Also it had a bad smell!<br />Am used to the Haribo bears, sold in the US market, they have a noticeable taste, they are made in Turkey. While these bad Frogs are made is Spain....maybe that why they taste and smell funny!!?"
47051,B001E5E3B2,YUCK YUCK and DOUBLE YUCK!,"This is, by far, the worst tasting cereal we've ever had.  The raisins are fine, it's the flakes that leave the most horrible taste in your mouth, sort of a cross between fake bacon bits and cardboard.  My entire family complained about these, even our 3 year old who will eat ANYTHING, pushed her bowl away after one bite.  We bought some other types of cereal from U.S. Mills and it wasn't very good either, but this was definitely the worst."
544581,B001P3PR54,Great stuff,My dog can't wait for his treat. He looks forward to them when he comes in after his morning excercise.
5990,B000I6PXLC,A treat for all the senses.,"Sounds corny but oh so true.  The aroma is pungent with the savory smell of coffee and the sweetness of chocolate.  The chocolate flavor is rich yet delicate so it doesn't overwhelm.  I purchased four bags of the ground coffee first for my daughter.  She insisted I taste it even tho I don't like flavored coffee or 'dark' chocolate. I enjoyed it so much I took back a bag and purchased 4 bags of the whole beans to grind when needed for that added freshness.  While I will not drink flavored coffee all the time, I feel it's a treat to start or end my day with a cup of this delicious coffee. My daughter also enjoys this coffee cold."
72104,B0019412IK,They were rotten/disgusting will not order from here again,"I love the Brothers-All-Natural Fruit Crisps... I'm deployed in Afghanistan and there is not much fruit, so these are perfect. I have had multiple boxes before but these strawberry banana ones I ordered were disgusting. I had to spit them out and rinse my mouth out with water for about an hour and I could still taste it, not sure if it was the banana or strawberry. I checked multiple other bags in the two cases and they were all shriveled/brown so I threw them all away. Pretty disappointing."
5271,B0012YEKCW,Cat grass,"My cat love this grass. Really easy to grow, only 3 days. Im not going to count the seeds but i dont think they are 500 seeds."
1999,B001E5E29A,"Good pancakes, lots of work","I love this pancake mix.  I bought my first can from Whole Foods Market about a year ago.  My only complaint is, for all the work you have to put into making them (at least the pancakes anyway) you could just as easily make pancakes from scratch.  You have to add your own egg, whole milk, and melted butter.  One thing I have noticed about this mix is that it's relatively difficult to burn the pancakes.  It is, however, easy to overcook them."
117720,B001BM8SS2,Can't go wrong with organic,My son gives the carrots 5 stars but isn't a fan of the peas however that's all on the learning tummy of a baby and nothing to do with the product. I've got no complaints.
482017,B000ED7MR2,Good,I like these to put in my morning oatmeal or cereal. I gave then only 4 stars because to  eat them out of the bag I had to rinse of the flour covering.
5464,B00622CYVI,Great Product,My one year old loves this product. She eats one every day and never gives me a problem. And I trust the ingredients which reassures me that she's eating something thats good for her.
256777,B003G52BN0,BETTER THAN THE REST,"If you like coconut in your coffee, this is the one. I have tried the Donuts Shop Brand as well as the Jamaica Me Crazy and this one by far has a smoother roast and cleaner flavor. I use coconut flavored creamer which makes a heavenly combination. I wonder if Keurig is safe for using coconut water?"
1828,B001RVFDOO,NOT worth the online order NOR is cheap $$$!,"I first tried the BBQ flavor at a restaurant, which was good. Then, I was carried away with the 1/2 fat part, which made me pay without realizing my mistake!<br /><br />The ""Salt & Pepper"" is OK! ONLY OK, after trying another one, I changed my mind!<br /><br />The ""BBQ"" is good, but not that good!<br /><br />The rest is pure trash! I did not like them, what-so-ever nor my other 4 friends!<br /><br />The price is wayyyyyy high, and not worth it for a small single serving, as others such as Utz is WAYYYY better and cheaper!<br /><br />3 starts is too much for this over-marketed, less of flavor, and over-priced snack!<br /><br />AVOID!<br /><br />2 stars off: bad flavors<br /><br />1 star off: PRICY AS SH**!, and not worth it!"
54853,B001HTRDVM,Misleading Label,"This product IS misleading.  Soybean and/or canola oil are the first ingredients, and olive oil is further down on the ingredients list.  I'm looking for a mayo made with olive oil.  Soybeans and canola are now genetically modified, unless they are organic.  But even organic soy is not good for people with thyroid issues, autoimmune disorders or digestive issues.  Soy is causing a plethora of health issues.  Organic or not -- soy is not good for us...and neither is genetically altered canola."
533742,B0005ZZI8E,TOTALLY gross.,"This stuff is garbage!!<br /><br />If you don't believe me, then try them and watch your teeth do all the talking!!<br /><br />1 star."
1765,B001RVFDOO,Entire family loves them,"loved the assortment pack. everyone in family loves them.  low fat, lower calorie and all natural, simple snack for kid's lunch bags. It is peanut and tree nut free (safe for allergy kids) and although it is made on equipment shared with wheat, I bought this for my child who is on an wheat limiting diet."
28967,B001ACNWY8,AWFUL,I AM NEW TO THE GLUTEN FREE COMMUNITY. I HAVE TRIED TO FIND BREAD OF ANY KIND THAT I CAN EAT. BREAD THAT IS CLOSE TO WHAT I AM USED TO. I CAME ACROSS CHEBE BREAD ON LINE AND THOUGHT HEY THIS MIGHT BE OK. I WAS WRONG VERY WRONG I'VE TRIED TO USE TWO DIFFERENT BREAD MIXES WITH ABOLUTELY NO SUCCESS. THE BREAD TASTES BAD THE TEXTURE IS AWFUL. HOPING I STILL MIGHT FIND SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY TASTES GOOD. UGH
381094,B0007U5J40,Shorted,Was shorted by one bar.  It was supposed to be a six pack of bars but only five were in the ziplock bag they came in.  Hopeing they correct this problem.
10720,B00389Q4XW,Problem with making the cocoa,I have tried 4 times to make cocoa with this product.  Twice it appeared to plug the coffee maker and would only provide about one once of cocoa.  The other two times the product worked correctly.  I do not think it is the coffee maker problem because it has made dozens of cups of coffee with no problems.  So I can not recommend this product.
5163,B000WMPGDW,Yummy milk spread,"I was born in Argentina and this is a top of the line dulce de leche, to eat with toasts or as add-on to cakes (comparable to Chimbote).<br /><br />Note: I noticed that dulce de leche is an acquired taste. So unless you grew up eating it, you may consider dulce de leche to be a little too sweet."
52467,B000FA1HBQ,Black thai Rice,"The three packages of rice were shipped in a timely manner.  My only problem is that it arrived with a moth infestation in one of the bags and I had to throw it out. Frankly, that happened the last time I oredered black sticky rice from the Temple of Thai and I will not order from them again."
2073,B001E5E29A,Not sure what the hype is ...,"This mix produced some pretty bland pancakes.  Followed the directions on the canister and the batter was pretty thin which in turn produced some pretty thin pancakes.  Considering the ingredients that needed to be added, it would have been just as easy to create my own buttermilk pancakes from scratch.  I debating trying to figure out how to jazz up the remaining canisters I have left (maybe some pumpkin pie spice) but that won't help the thicken up the batter."
70355,B007I7Z3Z0,Better than most,"This came in a small box of ten foil packages three inches long and a half-inch wide.  There is a cut at one end that allows you to open the foil package so none of the usual difficulties with getting these things open just to spill out some of the contents. The package says to mix with one 16-ounce bottle of water.<br /><br />The powder mixed into the water completely by the time I was ready to put the lid on to shake it up.  It turned the water a light pink.  This flavor of Stix To Go does not have aspartame in it.  The box says sweetened with honey and indeed honey granules are the first ingredients, however there is also sucralose, similar to Splenda.  There is also maltodextrin, which is often used in soda or candy as a thickener, but it is made from real food not chemicals.  The other ingredients are the flavors and hibiscus extract.  WebMD says that hibiscus extract is used to improve odor, flavor, and appearance of tea.  The package also says that a serving size is half of a package at five calories, but you are told to add the whole package to a bottle of water, so beware if you are counting calories.<br /><br />The taste is not bad.  I do not drink anything with artificial sweeteners because I cannot stand the aftertaste, but I did not notice an aftertaste with this.  There is a slight aftertaste, but it did not last.  If think you are getting tea you are not.  This taste like kid's strawberry drink.  If you just can't drink water then you would probably like this."
75770,B004MO6NI8,"Really, how many sugar, carb packed energy drinks does this world need","66g of sugar in the form of High Fructose Corn Syrup. 260 calories (in the form of sugar carbs). 174mg caffeine. A smattering of vitamins. Yes it will keep you awake. And yes you will inevitably crash from it. (I did.) It does taste better than red bull and about the same as Rock Star. But seriously, 2 of these day as some people reported seems to be putting you on track for health problems. And why in the world does an energy drink need a skull on the front? I downed my can before doing an MMA session. The guys in my class were not extra intimidated when they saw the skull. (Bummer.) I did not have any greater than usual work out ability. Time did not slow down. UFC fighters and BJJ black belts did not run away in fear.<br /><br />This really isnt a bad drink, I was just hoping for something different or better or healthier than EVERY OTHER energy drink out there. Instead it just seems to be trying to cash in on some sort of bad a$$ mystique. While pumping you full of carbonated water, HFC and citric acid. (Also contains Soy?!?)  I'm going to stick with black coffee, green tea, yerba mate, exercise and multivitamins for my caffeine, energy and supplement needs."
26608,B000YSS7EO,Thought the grayish color was normal...,"I've been buying Happy Bellies for the past 6 months (though I didn't use it exclusively... I also tried other brands). I'd say I've bought probably 5 or 6 cans so far. Unlike most of the reviewers here who opened a seemingly bad can, most of my cans have been grayish/greenish color! I thought it was a bit weird that the color/consistency/smell is different from the other brands, but since the ""quality"" I got has been consistent (consistently bad...), I didn't think too much of it. And then one day I finally got one that looks ""normal""... I did some search on the internet and realized that I've been giving my baby bad oatmeal!!!! I feel so bad. I hope the company does something about it, and that FDA investigates on this issue. Has anyone reported this yet?"
6344,B001AW9PTO,Salt Lick,"The product is a good value for the amount you get, however it is way too salty.  The product is very dry and firm.  I think this would be good if they cut the salt content in half."
274523,B005GWYI3W,What's In The Package???,Can not determine the amount included in the variety of options because no weights are listed for the packages. It would be helpful to have this information before placing an order.
121032,B000ETXO8M,European Taste,Can't be compared with anything else. You either love it or hate it! I happen to really enjoy the taste.<br />Give it a try!
8782,B00434FTDM,A good soup on cold nights,"This is my favorite Progresso soup. The broth has excellent flavor and it's not too salty. Yes the veggies could be a bit firmer, but the pieces are large and tasty. It has some heat already, but I  usually add a few shots of hot sauce to suit my taste. If I really want to indulge, I'll chop up a few pieces of smoked sausage and add it before heating - heaven!"
5754,B003TIVBSU,"Beautiful, Aromatic, Fresh","I could smell the vanilla from the box it was packaged in. It was sealed shut, air extracted from the packaging, so plump & moist.  I specifically got this product based on the comments left from a Pastry Chef.  I am extremely happy with my purchase.  I will definitely be back for these again.  I use them in frosting and cake batters - it's soooooo good, words cannot describe the freshness you get with a real vanilla bean vs. an extract.  They were very easy to extract the beans from."
5475,B00622CYVI,Best Baby Food out there if you're not making your own!,"I am loving Earth's Best brand overall.  I set out with the goal of making all of our son's food.  However, when I returned to work full time the puree time was less.  So my go-to backup is Earth's Best Baby Food.  We're on stage two now, almost stage 3, and he loves them.  I appreciate the no added sugars / preservatives and that it's mostly organic.  He loves the taste and combos.  Good stuff, great product, LOVE IT!"
1824,B001RVFDOO,"Pop Chips, yum!","I first got the variety pack to try all the different flavors, then I picked 2 and ordered them on Subscribe and Save (1 each on alternate months).  It's much cheaper than the vending machine at work and they only have chips that are bad for you.  These chips are crisp, delicious, and taste salty, mmmmmmm good! Each bag has 230 mg. of sodium. They only have 100 calories in a bag, and the amount of chips in the bag is ample for one serving, unlike other 100 calorie snacks where you get 7 almonds, or 5 crackers....  Now I can have chips every day at work for lunch, no guilt!  The Salt and Pepper variety is absolutely delicious.  The plain is great for dipping, and the barbecue is full of flavor.  The salt and vinegar is very sour, if you like that type, and the cheddar and sour cream and onion varieties are good, just not my favorites.  A very good deal on Subscribe and Save, chips delivered to your door, individually bagged and ready to take for lunch.  Convenient!  Nothing bad to say about PopChips!"
51658,B0002PHEU2,Not that good.,I must have got a bad batch because it is not hot and has very little flavor. It was nothing like the reviews.
455649,B005HG9ERW,Refreshing as long as its cold!,"This water was very refreshing when it was chilled in the refrigerator.  However, I have a tendency to carry a bottle with me til its gone.  That means it might be a few minutes or perhaps a few hours.  I didn't care for this water when it was room temperature.  It had a metallic taste.  However, considering the benefits of ph balance I will probably still buy this again, but only in small bottles"
32962,B001P05K8Q,great product,"Have been purchasing for several years and this product helps with cleaning teeth and satifies the ""chewing"" for my dog! Recommend!!"
77961,B000VK8HCW,Life Saver,"My dog Annie has a health condition by the name of Megaesophagus,  anyone interested in learning about this can find information on the internet.  We had got to the point where we did not know what to feed her.<br /><br />Her regular dog food would get incapsulated in the slime, and she would vomit it all up including the slime. This food is high in protein and calories I add enough water to it and mix it well to where it passes through to her stomach.<br /><br />She has two meals a day  and thanks to finding this food I did not have to put her to sleep.  (Her condition had got that bad)"
1888,B001RVFDOO,"Love these, good variety pack","I do love PopChips. They work well with weight watchers, taste great and the crunch can't be beat. This pack has many flavors, with the salt and vinegar being my favorite, my husband loves the salt and pepper and my kids like original and cheddar.<br /><br />The one I miss is Sweet Potato. It is by far my favorite of the whole lot of flavors, but aren't included in this variety pack."
23913,B0013NUGDE,"Cheddar good, parmesan garlic bad","Some of these are quite tasty, but all are too salty. Way too much sodium.<br />The cheddar flavor is kind of like different-shaped cheetos, quite tasty.<br />Parmesan garlic on the other hand is terrible. Extremely garlicky with no parmesan taste at all, and too salty."
56029,B007IVE7AI,Stale and old,These bay leaves have absolutely no fragrance and will be useless for cooking.  I am disappointed because I wanted to love this brand of organice spices. Now I am leary of buying any other spices from them.
3916,B00449NWW6,Hannah's Pickled Sausages,"Was exactly what I was looking for. Super fast shipping! A bit on the spicy side,but great taste!!!!<br />Would definately purchase them again!"
436398,B000FFLTDM,Not Really...,"If you add about a 1/2 teaspoon of miso paste to each cup you'll have something resembling miso soup - but if you have to do that, why bother getting these ramen pks?"
631,B000G6RYNE,Tasty!,"The chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips. The bags are very strong - much thicker than, say, Lay's potato chip bags. Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips, salted just right. Because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion, some are cooked more than others, which gives it a more authentic, non-manufactured feel. Some people may not like that.<br /><br />I reccomend them!"
68554,B000Q61NYA,Yummy chewy little satisfying Chiclets,"Always a winner, been around for decades of enjoyment!  Two flavors included in box."
402626,B000MANI4S,Big disappointment,"This tastes nothing like caramel apple. I passed it along and gave it away to several people, who also gave it away because they did not like it either."
525895,B005FQH3B8,Repeat Buy,This is a Repeat Buy for me. My cats eat these and its cheaper and easier to buy in bulk.
314038,B004JX7OGW,What a ripoff !!!,I can Buy the same thing in Alaska for $9.99. And the only reason I rated it one star is because I had to.
379,B003YXWAF8,Heinz no more!,"This is ridiculous.  The best gourmet ketchup I have ever tasted.  It is pricey, but wow..love this stuff.  It would make a great gift for someone who is hard to buy for but loves their ketchup.  Yummy!"

58196,B0046HHU0Q,"A Good Lunch, But Not A Great Lunch.","This was one of those afternoons when I was all alone and needed a quick afternoon lunch. So I opened a can of Amy's Organic Lentil and Vegetable Soup and added some crackers and a drink. It worked out well. The soup was thick and hearty and tasted rather well. If I had a complaint, I thought the soup to be a little bland. So I added a few squirts of Frank's Hot Sauce, one of my all-purpose brighteners, and that worked very well. It had a lot of fiber, was fairly low in sodium and sugars. The protein content was moderate. It made a good lunch, but not a great lunch.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
13982,B008Y1Y7PQ,Disappointment - salt overpowers all tastes,"I am a fan of Silver Palate cookbooks and was delighted to see this sauce on the grocery shelf. After getting it home and warming it in a saucepan, I gave it a taste. It was so salty, it was inedible. (And I am not reluctant to use salt.) 660 mg of sodium per 1/2 cup? Are they serious? The salt overpowers any subtle flavors in the sauce. With hypertension representing a major health problem, this is irresponsible. It leaves a bad taste in more ways than one."
9234,B006N3IG4K,Excellent coffee,This is an excellent full-bodied coffee without a bitter taste. In general the Wolfgang Puck coffees are quite good although a little more expensive than some of the other K-Cups.
67624,B007OXJK3Y,Disappointment,I was very disappointed with the taste of the coffee.  It was nothing like I expected.  Did not taste like a chocolate glazed donut at all.
10650,B001KVNDM0,Good product but wrong description,we bought this based on what Amazon mentioned in its product description which says 100 calorie pack but this is not 100 cal pack they are infact 250 calorie pack.Nothing wrong with the item as such and not that I'm going to return it but I would prefer a 100 cal pack over a 250 cal pack. Amazon please correct the prod description.
390634,B004I3VXJC,I would buy it again...,I like the quality and price of this produce and will buy it again when this order runs out.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for quantity AND quality.
22480,B004YRQ7BG,"Hard to find, but finally located online at decent price.",A friend had a craving for these and I was glad to find them.  The price wasn't too bad and they taste as we both remember them.
41825,B0090X8JUG,hate it,we've got 3 because of the deal and we hated it. smells very bad and tastes even worse. i will never buy starbucks coffee again. CommunityCoffee is much better for that price.
23184,B004ZIER34,No acid taste.,"I am not coffee connoisseur, but I love lattes and coffee in general. I usually drink instant coffee, but recently realized that it tastes sour/acidy. For some people making a coffee is a ritual and they probably will think I'm a heretic (like my friend from Ethiopia is always shaking head when I show up with Starbucks in my hand- I'm from Central Europe and shake my head when someone makes mashed potatoes out from the box-desecration of potatoes;)<br /><br />To try Puroast low acid coffee I poured hot water over 2 big teaspoons of Puroast coffee, add some powdered coffee creamer and it was tasty! Of course the coffee grounds are annoying, but there was no acid outcome.<br />I guess now I will try to find low acid instant coffee or maybe will finally buy small coffee maker (I'm the only coffee drinker in my house)."
500620,B003QNLUTI,It made me fall asleep,"I drank some to try and keep me awake for an essay, I fell asleep about 15 minutes after drinking it. I don't feel it did anything for me."
30700,B000EYRBSQ,Not For Me,"Everyone in my office loves these except for me.  It does not suit my taste.  However, since everyone's tastebuds are different, you may need to try them for yourself."
567,B000G6RYNE,HORRIBLE I CANT BELIEVE THIS!,"Terrible! I cannot believe this, I received this item and EVERY SINGLE BAG WAS OPENED BUT 4!!!! I'm stationed in Afghanistan and this was gonna be a snack for my team while going out on missions. I was so embarrassed when the bags were opened and spilt out all in the box, gross! And the box is filled with grease stains. Idk if it was from the airplane ride all the way here, but the box should have been more insulated and bubble wrap should have been used instead of paper. I'm very unhappy with stale crusty chips out the bag and us soldiers cannot enjoy now."
1932,B0016PKA1C,Works great!,Actually saves my basil and cilantro for an extra week or two. Thats enough reason for me to buy! Before my basil and cilantro would last only a couple days and I would have to toss them out. This saves me money and a trip to the market!
3398,B005K4Q1VI,Very good hot cocoa,"I enjoy this cocoa very much, the children love it and drink it often.  I would purchase this product again."
343232,B000WFEN74,Very disappointed,The cans arrived all banged up.  I will never order from this company again.
526090,B0049J2VUA,Arrived in one box with a 12-pack and a 24-pack inside,"My items arrived intact, with no breaks or leaks.  The packaging of my 36 individually wrapped chocolate liquors didn't look like the photo on the item's detail page, but the contents were what I ordered."

6251,B000E65OF6,My Absolute FAVORITE Evening Tea!!!,Just 1 cup in the evening caps off my day and gets me relaxed and is a permanent part of my bedtime prep.  This CS Sleepytime Tea is my absolute FAVORITE evening tea ritual!  I think it is the wonderful flavor of camomile plus the spearmint that adds that extra something refreshing...ahhhh...(sigh)...big yawn...I'm toddling off to sleep now........  P.S.  I also love a cup anytime I'm feeling somewhat stressed and especially whenever I need to wind down like after a long time on the computer or after stressful shopping trips.  Take a cup and you'll really be in a mellow place.
357,B000U9V5AU,Taste-tested by a wine maker,"I bought this strawberry extract hoping to spruce up a strawberry wine that ended up with less flavor than I'd original expected. (A common problem in some fruit wines.)<br /><br />This is, indeed, good strawberry flavor!  Just add to your sugary concoction (be it a baking good, a dessert or a drink) to either give strawberry flavor (or add to existing flavor), and presto, just about everyone will be licking their lips (and maybe fingers).<br /><br />For those interested, I found the right addition to a liquid volume to be 4 oz of extract per 1 gallon of liquid."
49895,B0000U7R1A,Knorr fish boullion,A must for every kitchen!  Adds flavor to every seafood sauce you make.  So disappointed that Knorr no longer offers this product in the supermarket.
74545,B007OXJJE4,Vermont Country Blend & Tullys House Blend,We brewed 2 cups of the Vermont Country Blend and found very weak.  We brewed about 5 cups of the Tullys House Blend and did not care for the taste.  I should have gotten all San Francisco Bay coffee's. We purchased French Roast and one other flavor and my whole family loves this coffee.
17410,B004P8JNFQ,"Great for ""catkins"" diet","We started buying 100% meat diets on our vet's recommendation for getting our big fatty to lose weight on a ""catkins"" diet.  Cats are obligate carnivores, so feeding them other foods that contain rice, or lots of vegetables, really isn't in line with how their bodies have evolved.  The vet recommended Before Grain and Wysong, but my cats very clearly told me they like Before Grain much better.  They lap it up, have become a healthier weight (the fat one lost, the small one gained), and have had no tummy problems ever since they switched off Friskies and onto this!<br /><br />My understanding is that cats do need a few vitamins, since they do get some semi-digested vegetables from the guts of their prey.  We mix in some Wysong ""Call of the Wild"" into the meat.<br /><br />Turkey is their 2nd favorite fowl, more than chicken, but less than quail.  My understanding is that cats naturally eat small fowl and rodents, so quail is actually the closest to what they actually eat in the wild.  I have trouble imagining a kitty cat taking down a big ol' turkey, but you never know!"
427079,B000NGNEKY,Best tasting energy drink out there,I was buying this from the companies site---don't its cheaper on Amazon...
464006,B003AOCRQI,Color NOT Actual,"If you are purchasing this cotton candy flavored snow cone syrup and expect it to be the blue in your child's snow cone, DON'T BUY IT.  I purchased this item thinking it would be blue (as shown in the picture) and it is red....the same color as the bubblegum flavored syrup I purchased.  Look for a blue raspberry flavor instead.  Hopefully that one will be blue."
25020,B0078Y6OX8,"Weak coffee, tastes fake","I found this coffee weak and not very appealing. The vanilla flavor is hardly present, and when you do get a taste, it is artificial."
3866,B001M074MY,What happened to Senseo decaf?,To make a decent cup of coffee I have to use two pods at a time. I prefer a strong cup of coffee even if it IS decaf.<br />What happened to Senseo decaf?
357328,B000LRH7GC,Bacalao Salted Cod,I thought the product was very good.I used some to make creamed salt cod and found the fish firm and tasty.Just like the cod I had as child.
4368,B004391DK0,I've tried them all--this is the best!,"Like the title says, I have tried (nearly) all the brands, spent a lot of money, and in the end these are the best Gluten Free Pancakes I've had.<br /><br />I am not happy about the lack of fiber, and the the starchy flours used. But a handful of ground flax seed makes up for that.<br /><br />I am also happy about a brand that helps you to make biscuits and other things from the same mix. Other companies sell biscuits and pizza dough as a separate item, duping the customer to spend even more money.<br /><br />Compared to the many other brands, these do not have a ""funny"" taste or smell from odd flours. These are made mostly from Rice and Potato flours. You just feel NORMAL.<br /><br />I hope they will come out with a ""whole grain"" version from Brown Rice and Bean flour.<br /><br />TIP: To get the fluffiest texture use BUTTER instead of oil. Room temperature butter."
8909,B000S9K0IA,my cats love this product,It is not cheap... probably a little overpriced... but very high quality ingredients. NO meat by products
1607,B001RVFDOO,"Variety pack, packed lunches","I discovered Pop Chips awhile back and fell in love with the BBQ flavor- whole lotta flavor and satisfying snack or chip alternative. Hubby is a teacher, so he gets lunches made most days with healthier and tastier options than what is offered at school.<br /><br />Since I mix up his sandwiches offerings from week to week, I thought the variety pack would be different for him. He gets his crunchy fun and doesn't realize the Pop Chips aren't as bad for you than the reduced fat kettle chips he was getting. Score! Plain are fine, vinegar pack a tart punch and he really likes the salt and pepper flavor. Single serve size does leave you wanting more if consuming solo, but gives a good amount when enjoying with a sandwich."
2171,B000N5XCPM,My Dog Loves This Food,"My little Lhasa Apso mix was diagnosed with diabetes a couple of months ago, so I found Merrick's Grammy's Pot Pie to be low glycemic, and decided to try it. He loves this food! It has chunks of potatoes, carrots, and peas, not to mention chicken and apples. The only downside about ordering it from Amazon is the delivery method. The day the food was delivered, a van pulled up in front of my house and left the 5 cases of food I had ordered outside of my chain link fence next to the mailbox. Needless to say, someone could have taken it if I hadn't seen the delivery woman drop it off. I'm also disabled, and if it hadn't been for my next-door neighbor being outside at the time, I couldn't have gotten the cases of food into my house without her help. Many of the cans were also extremely dented. Delivering items this way is not acceptable. I would have given this review 5 stars if it hadn't been for the delivery."
57338,B00817GPWQ,Least favorite K-cup to date,These K-cups arrived in a timely fashion but when I've tried using them at all 3 size settings none of them are strong enough. It seems there is not enough coffee in them. I wrote a complaint to Van Houtte and they did not respond...So I've got nearly 50 cups that when brewed smell like chocolate raspberry but taste like water. Not happy.
6851,B001LG945O,"Refreshing, but has Unnatural Aftertaste","The drink is 100% juice concentrate reconstituted with carbonated water.  It tastes like a cross between <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GN4OHK"">Orangina Sparkling Citrus Beverage with Natural Pulp - 24 Cans</a> and the orange drink from McDonalds.<br /><br />It was refreshing at first, but the aftertaste is abrupt and almost chemically.  It's odd, because the drink doesn't have any unnatural flavors, according to the ingredients list.  If the end flavor was more natural, I would definitely buy it again."
73211,B001EO65D2,PEGGY,I BOUGHT THESE FOR MY AUNTS FOR CHRISTMAS I HAD BOUGHT THEM A KERIG COFFEE MAKER AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF COFFEE TO GO WITH IT.
3616,B000HDMW9M,Great,"At  $3.33 a can, these are expensive for what they are, but are well worth it. The mackerel are of very high quality, are well packed, and not overcoooked or smoked. Also, since fish is the only meat I eat, I end up having a can almost every day."
4290,B004391DK0,$26 is too much...,"Just in case you don't know - these are about $4 a box at the store, so anything more than $12 for a 3 pack is not worth it.  This is a great product, though (that's what the 4 stars are for).  The pancakes & pizza dough are great, I make them all the time."
25406,B003WE8KLW,"smooth, chocolatey snack","Just 170 calories of protein and sweet to cure a craving, throw in a lunch pale or have between meals.  A little difficult for kids to open, so may need to start a little tear for them but I'm a believer and I'm making another order of these today!"
45478,B000LKVHOW,A mistake and a real disappointment!,"I ordered this item by mistake.  I thought I was ordering the Pizza Crust which our family just loves.  When I saw that I have made the mistake, I decided to give it a try - we now had 6 packages.  But this was the worst GF bread we have ever made.  Had to keep putting it back in the oven because the middle was raw and outside was hard as a rock.  We tried to eat it, but just threw it out - the first time I have ever hated a GF item so much!"

The whole family loves them. When the grandkids come over they wipe me out. The 2 year old looks for the container sitting on the microwave and says Paw Paw, Stick. These come once a month via the Amazon Subscribe and Save. Just another great quality Jack Link's product. One of the few companies that got big, but never sacrificed quality in the process!"
21142,B002QWP89S,Greenies are awesome!!,"My dogs go crazy for these!! I was worried for their safety since I had heard some negative reviews for these chews, so I did some research and found that the most common problem is from choking.  They do chomp them down so I have them eat it while I'm nearby in case they choke (haven't yet).  Their teeth and gums are clean and strong so that saves $$ on dental bills.  I don't like the idea of having them go under general anesthesia just to get their teeth cleaned (seems much riskier), so I will continue to take the ""risk"" with Greenies. Amazon price for these, even with shipping costs, are still the lowest. And my dogs get to bark at the FedEx guy!!"

80935,B0029JW9JU,Yuck!,"Those people who wrote positive reviews on this pepperoni are definitely their workers doing their job behind the computer.<br />These smell bad, taste bad and looks bad.<br />I love pepperoni, I love them cooked but preferably eat it raw.<br />They should be licking finger good. But Nope! Not these.<br />It has that after taste and before taste. Very strong beefy like taste.<br />Like that other one star review, it smells awful but not that bad when eating.<br />It is edible but definitely not enjoying ones.<br /><br />I'm gonna try to put these on pizza and have it cooked all the way.<br />Or else We're gonna throw away 6 packs of these."
70821,B000E4ALGU,Disappointed...,"I also had ordered these bars and had my ordered cancelled. They had the money pending out of my bank account, and had sent an e-mail stating that this item was on back order and should ship within 7-10 days. Then, a couple days later,  they decided they had listed the wrong price so they cancelled their orders. They should not have sent out an e-mail stating they were backordering when that was a lie (they obviously have no problem today having it in stock). I will not order from this company again..."
7798,B003P7ZN70,disappointed,"I ordered two 24 can packs of 11.5 oz. V-8 juice, which were boxed together and filled with inflated plastic to buffer. When i opened the box, although all the flip-tabs appeared to be intact, one can had leaked some of it's contents and the juice was all over the other cans and inside the box. I weighed the cans to find out which one/s had leaked and that's how i determined which one to throw away.(the weight of the cans varied, but the variance was consistent, except one can was a few ounces short)  I am hoping it was just from the one can and i don't turn up with salmonella down the road. Since this was a UPS delivery, i am kind of surprised that amount of pressure was put on this package. Usually get superior service from them. I have ordered like this in the past, and the product arrived in perfect condition, so as i said, i was disappointed this time."
8448,B003VXFK44,Sweet Coconut Flavor with A Mild Aftertaste.  Mild to Medium Blend.,"Jamaica Me Crazy is a sweet, coconut flavored coffee that has a mild aftertaste.  It is not a bold blend, but rather a mild to medium blend that leans more mild.<br /><br />This is certainly not a first cup of morning coffee for die-hard coffee drinkers who lean towards the medium to bold blends.  I would consider it a second cup of morning coffee, afternoon pick me up coffee or a dessert coffee.<br /><br />Flavor is OK.  I would like it better if the aftertaste didn't linger.  For a flavored coffee, it isn't bad & if you are a coconut fan, it is a blend to try on for size."
28292,B000RFS57I,Received a package of beef sticks with mold!,"Jack Links beef sticks are apparently fine, if you like eating mold. I can't give a review on the taste because I haven't eaten any of the beef sticks.  I was shocked when I opened the box to see a package of beef sticks with white mold on the front and the back.  I wrote to Jack Link's about it but haven't received a reply.  Apparently quality control and health concerns for the customer aren't important to Jack Links.  The mold on the package was very visible, so whoever packaged it and shipped it out to me didn't seem to care all that much.  I'm so grossed out that they would send me this unappetizing and unhealthy product.  Blech!  Will be returning the whole shipment shortly."
5993,B000I6PXLC,A real fan,"I have really fallen for flavored coffees and I consider these to be some of the best-- so much so that I'm on the regular shipment list now.  I'm sure I drink too much of this but I love the flavors.  Try it, I'm sure you'll like it."
350364,B000JZEABG,They're 1/3rd of the price from Costco or Sam's Club,"I ordered these for $14 from this site, then walked into Costco the next weekend and found them for $5.  What a ripoff!"
54970,B000IHJEDE,Yucky.,"I really wanted to like these. I just don't like burnt cheese, and that is what it tastes like.  Don't waste your money.  I should have read the reviews."
1058,B000XB80CG,Not exactly as described,I was expecting to receive only Starburst. When I received this it was half Skittles which I did not want or need.  I needed only Starburst.  Next time I will just go to the store.
315701,B0015YJD1C,Barbecue Chips,I love this product and order it on a regular basis.  Unfortunately the shipping carton was damaged during shipping.  I would suggest double boxing for shipment.

Contains Wheat and Soy."
13596,B0016889C6,Strange after-taste,"I've been on a ginger ale kick lately and switched to diet since every brand of regular ginger ale I can find sweetens their drinks with high fructose corn syrup instead of just regular sugar. Anything made with or from corn makes me ill, so I've been drinking. I've had the diet Canada Dry version, as well as various store brands from Brookshire's, Albertson's, etc. I ran to the grocery store near work today to pick up something and grabbed a six-pack of Vernors as there were no other options for diet ginger ale.<br /><br />The after-taste is almost like saccharine, even though it is sweetened with Aspertame. It is reminiscent of TAB soda. The taste of ginger ale is there, but there is a chemical-esque taste as well - almost soapy.<br /><br />I won't be getting this brand ever again."
6951,B001LG945O,A fine citrus beverage from The Switch,"The Switch Orange Tangerine is a nice beverage that is lightly carbonated and is made with real fruit juice.  Unlike most sodas, The Switch products are made with real ingredients (none of the High fructose corn Syrup) and it tastes great.  The cans come in a convenient 8.5 ounce can and they're great for lunch or an mid afternoon treat,  If you want a light beverage that's made with the ""good stuff"" then you'll want to grab a can of The Switch.  Do yourself a favor throw out the HFCS sodas and make ""The Switch""."

78472,B004M4W80U,Liars!!!,I realize once they came in the mail that I paid double the amount for each box. This is no deal I paid five dollars a box and they had a price tag on the box for two dollars and fifty cents
18445,B000QYH0FI,Really bad save your money,For something that is close to 60 bucks this was very dissapointing. The basket I received looked nothing like whats in the picture. I got a small foil pack of maybe 10 crackers no chocolate candies and a small box of candies that i can get at walmart for 2 bucks. They even changed the contents of the items without notifying me. This will be a NEVER again buy.
4850,B00139TT72,NOT organic,The chicken is not organic. It is the MAIN ingredient. This is NOT organic dog food. It is marketing lies to fool you into thinking you are paying more for quality ingredients when you are not getting organic chicken.
425885,B000TQEWM2,Didn't Care For This K-Cup At All!!!,I received one of these in a sampler package I had ordered of different flavored coffees from the Official Keurig.com website. I just didn't like the taste of it. I would not order this K-Cup again.
9017,B006N3IG4K,Milder than expected,"Never had Hawaiian Hazelnut before so I didn't know what to expect, but it turns out it's pretty good, not as flavored as say DD, but nonetheless pretty good.

65377,B000WER5RA,pls dont feed your dog this poison,"I've recently brought my dog this low budget meal sadly because I live off scholarship money and student loans and no longer live with my parent.......... I was temporarily buying my dog this food until my money came from school because I usually feed my shizu Purina one and refrigerated dog food. ........This food had my dog sick,hair fallen out in clumps, itching badly and throwing up............... I had to call my mother and have her to go out and buy her the food she usually eats. Yes I portioned the food to get her adjusted to the new food and I've done this for two months. I couldn't go on longer feeding my dog this poison ,........so if you love your dog stay away from this food........"
18472,B000BZ6LXO,EEEEWWWW.... GNATS!!,I use to buy this all the time with no problems. I had brought other soil that didn't compare to the quality of this one but the last go 'round of pots I soiled are infested with gnats. An extreme amount. Its spread to my other plants and the soap water trick is not working.<br /><br />I'll have to buy bug spray for house plants now. Try something else.

55712,B00141QYMC,Beware...made in China,My dog loved them but I was very disappointed when I saw the small print noting that the product was made in China.  I will not purchase this product again.  China has a dismal record regarding food safety and I am shocked that this company would produce this product in China.  At least let people know in your product description.

34081,B000LKVDUU,I've had better,"I bought a bunch of the Kitchens of India items during a promotional sale and the only one I'd recommend is the butter chicken sauce. If they were tasty I could overlook the salt content for the occasional enjoyment but I'm not loving the taste. I ofter buy similar products from Trader Joes and those, in my opinion, are much better and cost far less."
7585,B000CQ6KSI,Love Annie's,I am a big fan of anything Annie's so it is no surprise I give these 5 stars. There is simply no comparison between 'the chessiest' and the truly chessiest mac & cheese - which is Annie's. I enjoy the white cheddar the most.

80068,B001ET5XZS,"good quality tea, worst flavor","My work has all the flavors of mighty leaf. This is by far the worst flavor. It tastes kind of like one of those cheap flea collars, and tobacco. No one orders it again, or compliments it. Some people ask to try another bag. I would recommend trying it in a sample pack, so if you hate it.. you only have to ditch two bags, and not a whole box."

1836,B001RVFDOO,Awful,"I was at a charity fund raising event where they were handing these out. They seemed pretty tasty, so I bought a couple bags at Target. The ones I bought (Barbeque and Salt and Vinegar) were AWFUL! I ended up throwing away most of them, neither I nor anyone else who tried them could choke them down. The ones they were handing out as samples were clearly very different from what they are selling. Don't waste your money."
3248,B005K4Q1VI,Hot cocoa k-cups,I have tried different brands of hot cocoa from dark to milk and the Grove Square milk chocolate k-cups have by far been the best.  They're big critics in my family and they have given two thumbs up.  I would recommend anyone who enjoys hot cocoa to purchase this brand.
352122,B000M0F58U,great product,I bought this for treating symptoms of menopause.  It has been a life saver.  thank you

43998,B0031U9VI8,Way overpriced,"I too, thought I was getting 4 pouches, and because they are so easy and nutritious I ordered 5 different pouch recipes. Boy was that a rough day. I usually so look forward to getting my amazon packages. This was a let down, a major let down. Way overpriced, and confusing to order. DO NOT order these, unless you are prepared to pay that for 1 pouch."
73766,B000YUOZU2,Delicious liqueur chocolates,I was a little disapointed as they were a gift. The shipping was not adequate and consequently the case for the chocolates came loose and some of the liqueurs had leaked and were sticky.
77665,B001LG940E,Not the best taste,While this may have everything 100% natural in it I did not like the taste. This is naturally a personal preference. I would not say this is a bad product just because I did not like the taste. It was decent and could easily appeal to a huge swath of people out there. I still would not give this to my kids even if they did like it as It would get them used to carbonation which would lead to soda drinking eventually. For now they hate carbonation and I would like to keep it that way.
3205,B005K4Q1VI,"Grove Square Hot Cocoa Cups, Milk Chocolate, Single Serve cup for Keurig K-cup brewers, 24 Count","I received the K-cups on time and in execellant condition. I usually drink coffee, but at night the Hot cocoa is good with a snack, just before bed."

247096,B003M5TG28,Meow!,What can I say...this is the only brand of food my cat will eat. She tears into the bag by chewing on it as soon as I get it. I have to pour in into a plastic container. It also controls hair balls.
19867,B00390T5JA,could be better for the money,I bought this unit because of the Kurig name thinking it would be a quality machine.I have had it  about nine months and have trouble with the pump not filling up the cup on either size.I called Kurig and they had no response other than descale it.For the price of this unit you shouldn't have to descale every week. I am very disappointed with this unit and wouldn't buy another one.I will try either a Cuisinart or Mr Coffee.Kurig lost a customer here hope others fare better than I.
1242,B000OK7UDG,Can't detect the prickly pear,"Loose prickly pear tea makes a great iced tea but it is very difficult to find in pure form.  This tea is black tea with prickly pear ""flavor"". The shipping cost is twice the cost of the tea.  If there is a prickly pear component it is all but undetectable when I drink it. It just tastes like regular black tea.  Very disappointing."
484248,B001428X16,NEVER GOTTEN MY ORDER,i have not gotten my order or heard anything from the seller even after sending out 2 emails
46598,B002GJ9JWS,Powder vs. mixed,"I was disappointed to discover that once mixed, the tablespoon value of end product required 3 times the quantity to make a sandwich, meaning those label values are multiplied times 3.  I might as well just eat regular peanut butter when I figured up the caloric difference and carbs and sugar.  The taste was good on toast, so I've gone back and given product an extra star for that."

In fact, she comes running when the wife bangs her little bowl because she knows she's getting the treat.  When I found Amazon.com had the food, I started buying it by the case.  I can't find it in the store any longer.  I hope they keep making it."
312778,B0008IT3YS,Decadent,These are the only brand of brandy chocolates to buy...one bite and your are hooked!
56175,B0016LL5DS,Not a Nutella-killer,"I love hazelnuts and hazelnut spreads, or so I thought. But it seems that the competition is still far behind Nutella in getting the right taste. The reason I bought this product is that American Nutellas have trans fats, which I obviously wanted to avoid, and the Nutellas sold on Amazon are not European ones or at least not German versions. But this hazelnut spread is just too sweet for my liking. It wasn't bad for a small change, but I will never buy any product other than Nutella, especially for this price."

556435,B000FP0JY2,great catnip,It is great...my cat loves catnip and this is no exception.  It will last a while and No issues with sender.
985,B00473OV2E,The Best,"This is the very best marinade you can buy as far as I am concerned---of course, everyone to his or her own tastes, but all in all, I think anyone will like it---I give it five stars..."
3194,B000LKXQ32,Refined Tea Taste,"If you like green tea that brews for 2 minutes max and you do not ""stew"" your tea by just leaving the bag in until the tea is bitter, this is the tea for you! Of course, it can be done that way, but IF you have refined tea taste, then you will like this tea. I, personally, love the taste of a good green tea. I am so glad to find this brand available online. No one sells it in my area."
81381,B002DHSECY,Great Cereal!!!!,I have been eating this cereal mixed with cherrios for the past year and have found it very<br />satisfying. I would reccommend this cereal to everyone.
46,B001EO5QW8,Hearty Oatmeal,"This seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands, but it is somewhat mushy and doesn't have quite as much flavor either.  It didn't pass muster with my kids, so I probably won't buy it again."
843,B000UWSQT0,not creamy...,"To my mind, a fine caramel should be creamy and melting.  These are grainy.  The flavor on these was fine, although a little sweet to my taste."
479881,B001E5E2BS,No Savings!,"It's the same price as in the grocery store, and you have to order three at a time.  Why would you buy from Amazon??"
1200,B008L19ZQ0,Delicious and easy,"I made these recently for a holiday party.  I have never seen anything go so fast!<br /><br />They were very easy to make-- just add a few ingredients, mix, and throw them in the oven.  I will definitely be buying and making these again."
6907,B001LG945O,Strange...,"On the face of it, THE SWITCH Orange Tangerine beverage sounds quite good. It's a mix of concentrated fruit juices with mildly carbonated water. No added sugar, preservatives or caffeine are there to annoy the health-conscious. You get 140 calories from one 8.3 ounce can. (Probably too small a serving for most people.) There are small portions of natural flavor and coloring, gum acacia, ascorbic acid (i.e., Vitamin C) and soy. In case quantities, it's priced at under a dollar per can. Sounds pretty decent, right?<br /><br />The trouble is: it just doesn't taste that good to me. There is a vaguely unpleasant metallic quality to this stuff that I can't imagine many people warming up to. Perhaps the juice has reacted with the aluminum of the can. Perhaps my can had been sitting on the shelf for too long. Perhaps the acerola juice in the mix is an acquired taste; it's something I haven't tried before. Perhaps I got a bum can. Perhaps THE SWITCH just plain sucks. I really don't know, but I do know that I won't be drinking any more of it in the near future."
1740,B001RVFDOO,excellent!,I am very impressed with the flavors. ALL OF THEM! There were a few flavors I wasn't sure I was going to like....but they are really good also! The flavors are very intense. You are not getting a bland chip. I'm on the monthly plan but I've already had to order them ahead of schedule twice!
8091,B000NY6PPW,Language Barrier,"I would we willing to try this product, and have six envelopes in my cupboard, but unfortunately the instructions are in German.  Maybe I can hire an interpreter??"
26375,B005HGOIQ4,Coconut sugar Madhava,It was only $3.99 for 16 oz. at the Natural Grocers.  It was the Madhava brand and it was for both the blonde and the dark.
442,B000G6RYNE,Yowzah!!,"For me, Kettle is the best brand on the market. They really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the gods! I didn't think anything could top their salt and pepper chips, but these are my new favorite. The flavors are pure and real. They go great with just about everything and are highly addictive! I hope they come out with a low fat version; their low fat chips are excellent but they need more flavors."
61115,B000FA38ZY,Great cookie!,"Marshmallow on a cookie base, covered in chocolate. Whoever thought up Mallomars came up with a real winner! How can you go wrong with that combination, plus the expertise of Nabisco making them? The answer to that obvious question is ; you can't!  One of the best treats around, hands down! Very well packaged too. They were very fresh, something that is vital to any treat in general but especially one with marshmallow. Stale marshmallow is NOT good!  The only problem I had with these is that I could not leave them alone...until they were gone!"
487887,B004AW3YYI,Best Chai anytime....anywhere,"You can't buy this chai, premade, in any store.  I rather have it at home or make it on the go!"
306776,B000RI1W8E,Snap into the SlimJim!!,"Excellant product, been hooked on the stuff for decades. I wouldn't change a thing on them, except maybe make them have a longer shelf life"
394739,B001B4VOQI,Excellent Product,I donate this product to the local SPCA dog trainer. He swears by it. He only gives one or two a day to each dog so it last a while.
31157,B007M83302,not tasty,"Low calorie, its true. Try other flavors not Salt & Vinegar.  Wish I could return them, but we ate 2.  Or at least tried to, yuck!"
4172,B004391DK0,Fantastic!,It's great! I actually used this to make gf donuts the other day. I love how convenient it is. It's so hard being gluten free so this is god sent for how many things you can make with this. I have celiacs and I haven't had any sort of negative reaction to this. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who can't have gluten but still wants things like pancakes and waffles and donuts and other fun things.
395021,B001EO5SCQ,A little gritty,"We eat jerky all the time- backpacking, for snacks, just a convenience food! This, however, had a different texture that we didn't like. We ate it, but wouldn't buy it again."
2924,B000F9Z1WI,I'm a fan...,"Dude, these things are pretty good... as long as you're not bent on them being just like Oreos. I mean, they're not. But I definitely like them better than other chocolate cracker snacks like teddy grahams. The lightness of the crackers makes them perfect for slathering on other goodies, like peanut butter, cream cheese, icing, pudding, melted chocolate..."
38826,B000V6HQPA,chunky clam chowder,The product revealed itself to be incredibly small cans with hardly any clams or potatoes. I was really disappointed by price and the size.
66910,B006J4MAIQ,Love Love Crunch,I use Love Crunch as a yogurt topping or mix it in with more boring cereals.  I have to stop myself from just eating it out of the bag!
8437,B003VXFK44,great coffee,"the aroma is awesome!!  love the flavor, really gets you going in the morning.  prompt delivery, this is definatly my husbands favorite single cup coffee"
58577,B001EQ54RS,Shells,"If you use these raw, then be aware each bag had pieces of broken shells. I use them in hot cereal and salads and have had the less than joyful experience of biting down on a hard shell piece.<br /><br />If you care about your teeth, you may want to buy them whole and break them up yourself. I've never found a shell in the whole ones."
5559,B002UQEOA4,Not that great,The taste is not horrible but it is not very good. There is not a very good mango flavor. I would not buy again.
444754,B000NMI7RI,GREAT DEAL,I get these every year for my Dad and this is the place I always come because of their shipping prices and the speed at which they ship.
6193,B000UOFW9K,My fave GF chip!  Delicious!,"LOVE these chips.  I think there are so many GF baked goods (be they less than exciting rice chips, heavy breads, grainy cakes, etc.) that just fall short of taste and texture.  I am knocked out by how crisp and tasty these are!  They are much like a popular orange triangular chip but better, even ""fresher"" tasting.  If I don't take a serving and put the bag away first, I'm very likely to mow through it in one sitting.  Products like these make me feel like I'm not sacrificing anything at all for the sake of going GF."
272514,B007OXJL0G,Yummy!!!,This is goood stuff!! I mix it with Caramel Vanilla dairy creamer and caramel vanilla stevia liquid drops. OH EM GEE!!! Delish!!
4352,B004391DK0,Very Good reviews!!,I've never made gluten free items before and I got great reviews from customers for my gluten free coffee cake.
6415,B002AYEBQI,Neither cat will touch it :( But dogs go wild...5 Star for Dog Food Treat,"We all know how picky cats can be.  It may be grain free, but food still smells, looks like, and fine details in label indicate ""highly processed"" with all the extra vitamins & minerals, which I think is the ""turnoff"" for the kitties. Doesn't say up front, but also contains New Zealand Green Mussell, which I am not sure how that ingredient fits in as I am not from New Zealand, but suspect locals rely on that for nutrients as we do mussells in this country.  They are spoiled on the real thing - minimally processed or raw rabbit, chicken, bird, wild caught salmon.  They will eat canned only if minimally processed.  Another cat food bites the dust but gives the dogs another treat! 1 STAR for not knowing about the New Zealand Mussell & for still being highly processed & therefore unpalatable as food for cats that love rabbit. 5 Star for a dog treat without the added hormones, grains, etc."
5330,B000BYLQW6,Best Treat Ever,"My puppy, Megabyte, is a very picky puppy.  After spending hundreds of dollars on finding treats that she will eat.  These are one of only two."
47798,B003AP7C1M,great pre-workout,functional pre-workout without all the extra add-ons that you pee out.  just what you need to get through your workout and nothing else.  cost-effective as well.
47816,B004UXXS5M,Do Not Buy Cookies Online,"Girl Scouts are not allowed to sell cookies ONLINE. So therefore, this sale is not from a GIRL SCOUT. Your purchase will simply be to help someone else make money off of Girl Scouts. ICK! I will be reporting this to GSUSA and AMAZON.<br /><br />BUY COOKIES FROM YOUR LOCAL GIRL SCOUTS OR CALL YOUR LOCAL COUNCIL AND THEY WILL SELL COOKIES TO YOU. YOU CAN FIND OUT WHO TO CALL AT GIRLSCOUTS.ORG."
149,B0064KU9HO,Ehhh...,These remind me of dog treats I made once using pumpkin and cinnamon. They're kind of bland and not my favorite Back To Nature product. But my finace really loves them so that's where the three stars come from.
526405,B001E5E1KA,Just a sticky lump not a powder,I have used Stevia regularly. These packets contained solidified lumps of Stevia. Now I am leery about buying any Stevia from Amazon
8893,B001EQ5EQE,Great coffee.....,"This is the coffee that our friends, who are originally from Italy, use every day.  They highly recommend it.  They also use  Lavazza Crema e Aroma Coffee Beans, 2.2-Pound Bag.  I have had both of these at their house and both kinds are excellent.  We get it using the Subscription  option which gives you a great discount AND free shipping."
7006,B004K30HO2,Great product! Great value!,"These cups work great! We have had a Keurig for about a year and use a refillable filter cup. Its so tedious to refill every time you want a cup of coffee. Especially at 4am before work! These cups are so easy to use and perfect for mornings when you just want a quick cup of coffee. The lids are a little tough to get on sometimes and they get stuck in the top of the machines occasionally, but still much less work than the filter cup we were using before. We get a basketful ready at the beginning of the week and they are ready to go each morning. It's GREAT! So much more affordable than the name brand cups. Great product, great value!"
529922,B00028HN5A,Organic is better somehow,I bought this catnip online along with a toy that also came with catnip. Well I tried the catnip that came with the toy and my cat didn't even notice it. Then I pulled out the organc stuff and my cat tried to claw the bag open. This is when I realized organic truly does make a difference.
410574,B000JSM27M,Good but very expensive. Sells in Indian store for $1.47,This is an outstanding spice and I use it a lot. You can buy this from an Indian grocery store for $1.47 for 100 gm and $5.99 for 500 grams. All these MDH spices are too expensive at Amazon.
7797,B003P7ZN70,Great,Great price and we did not have to leave the house and shop.  I really love the fact that there is no trouble with ordering.  Great product.
4421,B000E5AO8O,It's still the same.,I was glad I ordered this candy. It still taste like it did 20 years ago.
12134,B00141UC9I,Dog Won't Eat Them,"My dog loves chicken breast treats. That is, until I bought these. I'm sure this is simply a matter of taste. I don't know if the additives smell different or what's turning him off but he'll pick it up and then just drop it. He refuses to eat them at all."
80394,B0009XPD64,The only food he eats!,"My pure bread yellow lab is surprisingly a very picky eater and after going through several other brands this is the only food he will eat.  He doesn't have allergies that we're aware of and hasn't had any bad reactions to other foods, he just won't eat them.  Now I've moved to an area where I can't get this food at a nearby store, so I've come to Amazon.com to start ordering it regularly for delivery."
6903,B001LG945O,Not bad,"Switch Orange Tangerine is ok but not what one might expect.  First of all, there is more apple and grape juice in here than orange or tangerine (this will not be a surprise if you are familiar with the other flavors as that is also true with them).<br /><br />Switch basically is carbonated juice.  The taste isn't a bad and it is supposed to be healthier than soda (which can be debated).  It is a reasonable drink for snacks but if you are going to need several if you are actually thirsty."
1404,B00068PCTU,Best stevia product I ever used,"I used to buy this product in this size at a health food store in Florida for 27 dollars. Where I moved to in NY I could not find it in the stores so I looked online. With shipping costs, it still cost under 20 dollars.<br /><br />I use this product in tea and coffee and I like it better than real sugar. I don't find it bitter at all even when I accidently put a little too much in ice tea. Sometimes I forget it's not real sugar when it's in ice tea. I especially like that it has no other additives for texture or taste. I have used it in baking simple pound cakes and cookies and they were good."
8162,B001HTR4WA,Great packaging.  Decent price.  OK expiration date.,"These individually packed milk is great for on-the-road.  Does not need to be stored in the frig.  This item came in 6 packs of 3.  Then shipped in its original box and then another Amazon box over it.  The content was securely packed and I was not worried that the milk got 'dirty' during shipping.  The price is the same as in local grocery store but shipping to the house saved me from dragging them from the store while my toddler is jumping up and down the store aisle. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because of the expiration date.  It is Mar 2012 which is not too far away.  I just bought one from Target(because I forgot to bring one and my toddler was restless) and it has an expiration date of Sept 2012.  Overall, I would still recommend to buy from Amazon."
6928,B001LG945O,Great Orange Bevvie,Seriously a great orange drink on par with Orangina without being super crazy sweet.  I have purchased this frequently since my first taste of it through the Vine program. Also! Goes great with vodka or tequila!
208778,B000IEFVGG,Peanut explosion!,"Three of the six containers burst open during shipping, spreading peanuts all over the place.  I would never order any Klein's products again since they all appear to be packed in the same flimsly containers."
204,B0028C44Z0,A huge hit at the office!,"I keep a case of these in my office and always have at least a tin or two on my desk for visitors to help themselves to. Some folks stop by just to grab some mints and others pop them like candy while we meet. When I find someone who keeps coming back for more I just give them their own tin! One co-worker asked me to save the tins for her so she could use them as pillboxes and safety pin boxes. Like I said, theyre a real hit. Since I wouldn't be able to keep my hands off a candy dish, this is a good alternative to have around and it's nice to have them around if I have garlic for lunch! I gave the item 4 stars because they aren't as tasty as the sugar version of the mints  but what sugar free item is as good as it's full sugar counterpart?) and because of the fact that each tin is wrapped in plastic which seems like a waste and is irritating to remove (although I totally get why they wrap it - it still doesn't make it easy to deal with)."
248089,B00585GGZU,My Macaw thank you,"Goldie  my Macaw loves Macadamia nuts, but buying them at the store was breaking the bank, we purchased a year supply for one low price.  Thank you!!"
12235,B00141UC9I,DO NOT TRUST THIS PRODUCT!  MADE IN CHINA,"I had been buying my 2 year old Bichon Frise these Happy Hips Duck Treats for  months until recently when I purchased a large bag that, upon opening it, reeked of some sort of chemical substance which smelled very much like chlorine or bleach. The smell was overwhleming and disgusting. Not knowing what was wrong with it, just out of curiosity I looked on the back of the bag to read the contents and sure enough....at the bottom of the bag were those dreaded words, ""Made in China"".<br /><br />Up until this time I had assumed their treats were made in the USA, and some of them are. But after looking through all their products it seems that their duck and chicken breast treats come from China.<br /><br />Do NOT trust this product!!!"
4450,B002YZESWU,Great gift for the foodie in your life!,"Last year I gave this along with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1845979125"">Salt: Cooking with the World's Favorite Seasoning</a> to my foodie friends and family. They all loved it! The salt tubes were well packaged and I ordered 10 sets and had no broken tubes. The package also came with salt samples which I really appreciate. I have Collection Sets 1 and 2 on my counter and get lots of comments about them when people visit."
57868,B000EVOSE4,THESE ARE NOT VEGETARIAN,"I saw these gummi bears in the vegetarian section.  To my amazement, they should not be here.  They contain gelatin which is an animal product and it is not vegetarian.<br /><br />Here is the definition from Wikipedia:<br /><br />Gelatin (spelled gelatine in some Commonwealth countries) is a translucent, colorless, brittle (when dry), nearly tasteless solid substance, derived from the collagen inside animals' skin and bones. It is commonly used as a gelling agent in food, pharmaceuticals, photography, and cosmetic manufacturing. Substances containing gelatin or functioning in a similar way are called gelatinous. Gelatin is an irreversibly hydrolysed form of collagen, and is classified as a foodstuff, with E number E441. It is found in some gummy candies as well as other products such as marshmallows, gelatin dessert, and some low-fat yogurt. Household gelatin comes in the form of sheets, granules, or powder. Instant types can be added to the food as they are; others need to be soaked in water beforehand.<br /><br />Buyers beware of the ingredients of products you are buying, just because it says it's vegetarian doesn't always mean it is.  Look up the ingredients just to be on the safe side.  I hope this is helpful.  Whoever posted this item as vegetarian needs to do a little more research on what ingredients are considered vegetarian.<br /><br />thank you,"
43627,B003VTGCIG,not grape juice,"there are 2 upc's listed for this item. 070590080010 IS NOT 100% grape juice, but a blend of pear and apple juices"
57269,B00817GPWQ,Drinkable Flavored Coffee,"A sample of these Van Houtte ""French Vanilla K-Cups"" were included with my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA"">Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System</a> and, sadly, it was fairly disappointing. This seems to be a ""hit-or-miss"" flavor since there are so many positive reviews and a scattering of those who, like me, don't like it.<br /><br />When made on the ""Large Cup"" setting, the French Vanilla flavor was weak and slightly artificial tasting. It isn't really bad or undrinkable, but I will not be buying this flavor in the future.<br /><br />CFH"

3423,B005K4Q1VI,Surprisingly Good.,"Truthfully, I wasn't expecting too much with this, but thought I would give it a try for something different for my Keurig. I have to say, that I was pleasantly surprised at how good this is.  My favorite is the dark chocolate, but the peppermint is very good as well.  I am not a real milk chocolate fan, but I mixed it with some coffee for a mocha and it was very good. I would definitely purchase this again."

8026,B004SISLQ0,Bought at my local supermarket,I found this in the organic aisle at my local supermarket.  $[...] for one box of 100 opposed to 3 boxes being sold here with no shipping or waiting.  I would just like to know if anyone knows if this is a good quality for being a bagged tea.  I'm not a Pu-erh expert and I am looking for something as authentic as I can get without paying an arm and a leg.  Can anyone suggest a good quality??  The only reason I gave this a 3 is because it is something you can find at your supermarket without buying a pack of 3.
371129,B001EQ53BK,Great for protein shakes,I put about 30 grams into my protein shake along with my whey and it not only improves the taste but adds the carbs I need.
2182,B002SW7ZOW,Great oolong for the price,"I got tired of overpaying for tea at Teavana so decided to try this brand of Oolong tea and was pleasantly surprised. It has a wonderful flavor and like the previous reviewer, I just put the bag in a tea ball to compensate for the poor quality of the bags. You just can't beat the value of this tea!"
365335,B001SITWC0,Soldiers love it,We support a number of soldiers deployed to Afghanistan and several of them request peppered jerky above everything else.
5738,B003TIVBSU,Great beans!,"I've never bought vanilla beans before, but I have seen them in the store - all dry and crusty looking.  These beans are vacuum sealed, and because of that are still moist.  They smelled great.  My whole pantry smelled wonderful after I put them in there, and they made my homemade vanilla bean ice cream the most vanilla-y ice cream I've ever had.  (Even more vanilla-y than Blue Bell!)  When I run out, I'll absolutely buy more of these!"
170948,B000244OD8,My Favorite Chile Sauce,I discovered this stuff on a visit to St. Lucia 5 years ago.  For me it has the prefect balence of heat and flavor.
336203,B000BRR8VQ,These are amazing treats and a great value,Both of my mixed terrier dogs prefer this treat above all others. One of my dogs whines and scratches at the cabinet where these are stored wanting some!
361152,B000H0ZJIG,Crazy for Zukes!,"I bought these for training my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppy - she goes NUTS over these things, the peanut butter flavor too!  She will do just about anything to get some of these treats."
29668,B0001GUQ20,THE BEST SO FAR,"This is amazing stuff. The Minor's bases were recommended to me by one of the instructors at the New Orleans School of Cooking. He used some of the chicken base to make the eight cups of stock he used in a gumbo he was demonstrating. I've tried the beef and the chicken, and both are superb. They have a flavor that is identical to home made stock. The stuff keeps forever. Give any of the Minors bases a try and you will be sold. The only problem is the ridiculous shipping charge from Soupbase, the vendor. It's almost as much as the cost of the product."
7136,B004K30HO2,Disposible K cups via Amazon,The cups are a little tight for my machine. You have to press down on the handle really hard. Also the lids don't fit properly unless the filter is pushed down all the way into the cup.
18443,B004IJR8WM,"Oily, greasy fruit globs","I didn't like these at all.  These ""dried"" fruits (more like sopping wet with oil...and not just this brand) are far too oily.  I don't want sunflower oil fruit globs.  It's actually disgusting.  Hate to give something a terrible review, but it's just yuck. I like oil fine, where it belongs (french fries, maybe a salad?), but not in dried fruit.  They've managed to get rid of the sulphur and whatever else just to jam them full of sunflower oil (a preservative).  I'd rather just have the fruit dried, in a fruit drier, or sun dried.  I'd even rather the things just crumble to dust in my mouth than this.  Organic or not, it's just oily junk food."
5118,B003QM6ZDU,So good it could be a beverage!,I brought some of this back from a trip to Jamaica and wished I had bought it by the gallon.  It is very hard to find but WELL worth ordering in bulk!  It is a sweet but spicy sauce that takes me back to Jamaica with every taste.  I have attempted to duplicate it many times but can't seem to get it right.  I am ecstatic to finally have found a source.
229021,B000MXHQQ6,Really tasty!,My daughter loves this food! I tried it and its good!Added bonus is the DHA.
52801,B0005ZXPY8,"use in your swimming pool, too","You can use this in your swimming pool to raise alkalinity.  It's cheaper than the ""Alkalinity Plus"" product sold in swimming pool stores.  Use the same amount of baking soda that you would use of Alkalinity Plus.  1/3 pound of baking soda per 1000 gallons increases KH by 20 ppm (about 1 degree dKH)."

4950,B002RZ1QNG,This is a good wine but I made some modifications,"This wine actually turned out really well.  I made some modifications to the kit however.  If you figure out the potential alcohol content, this kit would probably get around 7%, but by adding additional sugar at the primary fermentation, I ended up with 13%.  I also didn't use the whole f-pack.  It would have been WAY to sweet.  Instead, I topped the carboy off with an unoaked Chardonnay that I like."
2391,B0089SPDUW,This is good coffee,It has a nice strong flavor with no bitterness.<br /><br />How strong is it? I would say it is similar in strength to auto-drip using 1 rounded tablespoon of coffee per 8oz of water.
29983,B000H23Z94,Good Stuff,We love the Orange Beef seasoning. We actually use chicken with it instead of beef. We had been trying to find it in the suppermarket to no avail.
532702,B000KRS5AA,Excellent Product,Pros: Delicious on just about everything. Seller shipped quickly.<br /><br />Con: Outrageous shipping costs. In order to justify it I ordered several shakers.
4931,B000FYYOZI,Yum,"Good, light taste.  Not too strong of a flavoring, and very little, if any, aftertaste.  They go down easy,...MMMmm.  Definitely happy with the purchase."
40626,B00020HHRW,Sage Tea - helping with hot flashes,"When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box.  The second box, not so much.  I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you."
7362,B000EDG4TE,good eating,"If you are a man this is the best you can do for your health, eat Pumpkin Seeds.  Bob's Red Mill has the best grown here in the good old USA.  The others are from China, enough said."

9198,B006N3IG4K,First but not last time to buy this one!!,"I LOVED THIS COFFEE. I just got my order a few days ago and I normally drink just one cup of coffee in the morning......Now I can't wait and have had an afternoon cup, too. I must say....I look forward to getting up in the morning just because I know I'm having this coffee!! TAHT SAYS A LOT FOR A LTE SLEEPER!! Try this one!! I like it on thenext to highest setting on my Keurig....it has an awesome aroma while brewing and the taste is smooth, never bitter and there is something that 'hints' of a slight fruitiness with the first sips......then the end of the sip is just a perfect brew, too. Never any aftertaste or bitterness. I am so happy to have found this!! Thanks Wolfgang! I have now ALL of your kitchen gadgets cookware and now the coffee too!"
228277,B003VXHGPK,Ew.,I bought a 24 pack of this an drank almost all of them before realizing what the flavor reminded me of. It tastes like hotdog water.
7592,B000CQ6KSI,No more fluorescent orange macaroni & cheese!,"No long, frightening lists of chemical additives, either. Nice to find something quick and easy that I don't have to feel guilty giving my kids from time to time. I have no problem paying a little bit of a premium for Annie's, it's well worth it.<br /><br />Oh, and for anyone who is getting lumps, take the package directions at face value and mix the cheese separately, then add the pasta."
5068,B001872UAW,Healthy Choice chicken Tortilla Style Soup,I enjoyed this soup.  It was flavorful with a nice blend of spices.  I will buy it again.

38254,B0030EGQAG,Just an AVERAGE shortbread cookie,"The cookies arrived badly broken.  The flavor is not bad, but just average. The texture is crispy; shortbread should be firm but soft enough to be almost ready to crumble-----it should come close to melting in your mouth."

5726,B003TIVBSU,very good price,"extremely good deal. i placed the order on tuesday, got the package on saturday. the packaging is very good (vanilla beans are vacuum packed as well as comes with a heavy ziploc bag for after you open the vacuum pack). 1/2 vanilla bean is about a little over 50 vanilla beans. every grocery store i go (wegmans, whole foods, weiss etc etc) that carries vanilla beans usually only sells them in packets of 2 vanilla beans for typically $12. so if you buy 50 vanilla beans 2 at a time for $12 each, thats $300! so basically you're saving $272.31."
10784,B004M71GPU,Bile juice,This is the very worse BBQ suace I have ever tasted and bought. I saw the man v Food  show which featured the stomach bile tasting thin sauce and then bought it ...wow  Texas really doesn't know BBQ sauce.

70428,B002E0S4UW,Big hit in our house but not with Earth,"The kids LOVE these. 100% natural, no sugars added.<br /><br />Purchasing in bulk with the Subscribe&Save has helped us save money.<br /><br />Super convenient for travel or for parties- leaves very little mess.<br /><br />My biggest issue is the waste. I feel guilty for purchasing/promoting a product that leaves behind so much trash. We don't usually buy products individually packaged such as juice boxes, 100 calorie snack packs, etc.<br />But these are just so dang convenient. I apologize to Mother Earth.<br /><br /> Wish there was some way for the bags to be recycled or composted."

625,B000G6RYNE,4 Stars for price and taste,"I got the sea salt and vinegar chips from Kettle.  I am used to the Salt and Vinegar chips in the white bag if I am allowed to say that.  Anyways, my first impression for this is wow at all the chips you get for the price.  I got the 9 0z x 12 bags and wow it is so many for the price.  You can tell they are high quality chips just from the packaging, also.  Well being used to the cheaper chips I wasn't expecting how mellow these things are.  The ones I am used to have a really sour taste to them which I didn't mind but they had tons of flavor.  These chips don't have any sour to them at all, and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste.  If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first.  So, for the price and how many you get, these chips are definately worth it.  They are thick and crunchy like the more expensive chips you get at high quality restaurants.  I recommend these, 4 stars."
5343,B004565GV8,Great but stale,"I like the Dessert Delights line, and this is one of their better flavors. But the carton I received contains only packs that are stale. The sticks are stiff and difficult to chew, and the flavor disappears within 10 minutes. I'm quite disappointed that they would dump old products on their customers."
291166,B004G4CNWO,NOT Vegan,"vendor had no description of ingredients except ""marshmallows"" when we ordered and product had been tagged as Vegan by another reviewer.

72650,B004X3VRLG,dogs didnt like,"kinda hard to review something, that an animal must eat, who can not provide other feed back than ""wag my tail and eat it"" ""eat it"" ""wag"" or ""vomit""...<br /><br />i mean i put em down and the dogs licked a few times but didnt want it.<br /><br />in my human opinion it failed. i cant tell why the dogs didnt like or want it. maybe they just werent hungry? maybe it smelled bad, but would have tasted ok..<br /><br />each dog is different.. so try it for yours. maybe your dogs will like.<br /><br />mine just didnt, and arent picky eaters either."
2902,B000F9Z1WI,THESE ARE TRUE 'MAINSTREAM' DIET SNACKS --,"FIRST THOUGHTS: BRINGS BACK OLD MEMORIES<br /><br />When I recently tried these little wafers I recalled when I worked in an office nearly 20 years ago. Whenever the Director skipped lunch, he ran all through the department pleading with all the ladies to pull something out of their handbags or desks that might get him through till 5 O'clock. He usually ended up with a couple of packaged saltines which had long since turned stale and were mostly crumbled from being crushed at the bottom of a handbag or desk drawer. I came to realize that some of the girls kept stale crackers just for him - I guess they really admired him. These 'Nabisco Oreo Thin Crisps, Baked Chocolate Wafer Snacks' would have served his purposes much better than the saltines, but I would rather he have more of his old favorites.<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: NICE FOR A DIETER AT COFFEE BREAK TIME -- BUT NO CREAM & SUGAR PLEASE<br /><br />Basically, this is a minimalist snack for people who have to eat something in-between meals and they don't want it to be a 600 calorie confection. That's why the biggest print on the label says, ""100 calorie packs"" -- 4.5 inches across!<br /><br />WHAT'S THIS STUFF ALL ABOUT: ENRICHED FLOUR + SUGAR + ""ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS"" & ""ARTIFICIAL COLORS"" & A LITTLE CANOLA OIL<br /><br />2 GRAMS OF FAT & 9 GRAMS OF SUGAR in a 23 GRAM PACKAGE = 100 CALORIES<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: NO PRETENSES -- SIMPLE LEAN SUGAR WAFER WITH THE USUAL ADDITIVES<br /><br />As diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you. One can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand, making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and blood-sugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack. For that purpose this is a great product and I know that our Director, 20 years ago, would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon. When the Director didn't find any saltines around the office he'd head straight for McDonalds and the rest was history."
77760,B001LG940E,Tasty soda,"This soda is all natural unlike many others that have artificial flavoring and sweeteners.  That, in itself, makes it ok in my book. The key takeaways from tasting this is that 1. It actually taste like a soda pop and not just juice with carbonation in it.  2. It's as sweet as artificial sodas without the artificial sweeteners. Since it's all natural I guess that's alright.  3. You can taste the grape juice in the mix.  It's as powerful as the black cherry flavor."
49828,B000BTKCLC,picture not accurate,the photo looks great.  Too bad what i got had slivered almonds - not a single whole almond in the box!<br />don't waste your money.  the picture looks NOTHING like what they send. They should have to put up a photo of what it really looks like.  they wouldn't sell any!!!!!  VERY DISAPPOINTED and feel cheated
150782,B001ESKSPO,Marcona Almonds,"These Marcona almonds are delish!  I am a big almond fan and these, without skin, are so yummy.  Can't eat any others!"
5473,B00622CYVI,Great baby food!,My baby loves Earth's Best product.  The food is tasty and doesn't cause her constipation problem.  I'm happy that I can find the organic and affordable food for my baby.
531830,B005K4Q34S,Good stuff!,"This product was just what I was looking for.  For those complaining of the taste, YES it does taste like something that comes out of those machines in convenience stores!  But that is just what I was hoping for, and got."
21425,B002QWP89S,Good Price,Buying the greenies online is the way to go..  They cost about $10 cheaper than if you were to walk into a chain pet store.
1628,B001RVFDOO,Pop0chips,"The PopChips were great and they were fresh when they arrived. For the price, I wish there were more bags of chips for my bucks."
262727,B00213IAUQ,Oh my gosh delicious!,"Lucy's Cinnamon Thins are crispy, yummy and entirely too tempting! They taste like snickerdoodles,and I can't quit eating them!"
393103,B003VXL0V6,So weak!,"I am only drinking it, so it won't be wasted, and I have to rotate it with a Coffee People product, so I remember why I like coffee.  It is really wan. The strongest flavor profile is tin.  I love creme caramel and am a huge WP fan, but the flavor strenth and consistancy of this coffee does not impress. Choose another - you won't be sorry you did."
269429,B000P41A46,Corn Syrup,OMG - this formula has corn syrup as the #1 ingredient - that worries me!
47551,B003EPIN70,Perfecto!,"There is EVOO and then there is Monti Iblei.  You will use this because you worship your food.  Drizzled over salad, pasta, fish, antipasti.  Sublime."
85265,B004KSQXKO,Not vegan,"I ordered these for my dogs because I thought they were vegan (no animal products are mentioned in the ingredients list) but I found out from the Paragon web site that they are not vegan. Next time I ordered Paragon's Rice Bones, which are vegan."
2459,B002JX7GVM,Very tasty,"I saw this item in my local grocery store, and I thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />I have to admit, I was very surprised about how much I enjoyed this item.  I found it refreshing, and I felt that I had a bit more energy. I would happily purchase this product again and again.<br /><br />A word of advice to people complaining that it doesn't taste ""coconutty"" enough.  Coconut water and coconut milk are two very different things.  Coconut water comes from a green, immature coconut, while the milk comes from what we all think of when we think of a coconut...a hard, brown, fiber covered shell.  Just like a green banana and a ripe banana taste different, the same can be said of coconut.  If you don't think of this as a coconut drink or a pina colada, you will probably enjoy it even more."
9277,B006N3IG4K,great coffee,The coffee was great. Spent some time in Jamaica and got to love the coffee. Nice to get in back home as well.
15444,B000PG1D1O,Tastes like sweaty gym socks,"I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me."
5434,B003AO5QZW,"Very Weak Flavor, Definately NOT Watermelon","Received 6 bottles of concentrate from Paragon. Mixed EXACTLY to their specs., and was extremely disappointed in four of the six flavors.<br /><br />I am truly saddened to have to encourage you to NOT purchase the Watermelon flavor.<br /><br />This item has be returned for a refund."
9232,B006N3IG4K,Unremarkable,"First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG"">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ"">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees."
7907,B00166D8TW,Egg Protein Review,"I found this to be a good alternative to whey based protein powder. I have only used this product for 30 days and am reordering. Before I get into my review, I might mention that I never thought of myself as whey or lactose intolerant, but after 3 months of taking quality whey protein I knew that what I was experiencing was not typical. (I'm talking about bathroom habits including frequency and consistency). I asked a few older guys in the gym what there experience was with whey, most if not all where fine with it and experienced no problems or side effects. One natural BB that is about my age late 30's suggested this egg based protein product and noted that one of his training customers found it to be an acceptable alternative to the milk based protein products.<br /><br />I did some research and to be honest the manufactures web site for beHealthyNFit is totally useless and outdated with little or no useful information. Their poor web site almost made me not buy this product. It sure didn't invoke any consumer confidence and in my opinion is totally unacceptable.<br /><br />How does it taste? I bought the chocolate (I'm not a chocolate lover but I think chocolate flavoring is the best option for protein powders) The flavor is chocolate but its defiantly not a rich milk chocolate and it wouldn't fall in the same category as a dessert. More of a taste that you can get used to.  I have also seen this flavor described as chocolate with a hint metallic. I'd agree with that. It has an after taste that some may find metallic.<br /><br />How does it mix? I mix this with water directly in a 16oz. ready to drink water bottle. I drink 1 or 2 ounces, usually down to the top of the label. Then I place a funnel in the top and dump in one scoop. Usually I will need to shake or tap the funnel to get the powder to pass through. Then I screw the top on and shake well. I have found that if the water is very cold the powder will clump more often and mix poorly. Room temperature water or water that is cool but not ice-cold works best. I use a wine fridge to keep the water at 50.( I don't like clumps) Note: The consistency is exactly like water, if your expecting this to be a thick or heavy drink then will be disappointed.<br /><br />I found that if you live in a humid state like Florida you will need to make sure that you screw the lid to the protein power on tight. If you expose this power to high humidity you will have a terrible time with it clumping and mixing properly.<br /><br />General tips for drinking protein drinks. I have found that eating a granola bar while drinking a protein drink helps. First biting the granola bar then taking a drink. I found this to work for me and it makes the occasional protein clump less noticeable.<br /><br />Is there room for improvement? Yes, loads of room for improvement. Is there anything better? I haven't found it yet but I am still looking. I will give this high marks until I find something better. Please leave a comment if you find a better non whey protein product."
346565,B000F0FP0A,Great Stuff,"Talk about a boost in the morning. I no longer drink coffee, besides this tea is healthier to consume. Thumbs up for this product. Cheaper to buy in a 6 pack."
67533,B007Y4BIBK,Gross!!!,It tastes absolutely horrible...  That's pretty much all I can say about this product.  You can get a free sample at their website before buying.
4881,B002C56OBU,Great coffee for a great price,"I'm no coffee snob but this is still much better than crap you get a Starbucks (I drink black coffee so flavor really matters when its not covered by caramel and other junk). Great coffee for a great price, especially if you get it when Amazon is offering the $3 off coupon."
57737,B000EVOSE4,LUV Bears in Bulk!,I stumbled on this by accident and am oh-so-happy I did!  My faves are the pineapple flavor!
210533,B000CQG8M6,My daughter loves it!,"Based on my daughter's opinion, I am giving this tea 5 stars.  She asked me to buy her this as a Christmas gift."
207626,B000ER1EPE,Great tasting (vegan) cookies...not just for kids!,These cookies are just delicious...PERIOD.  They just so happen to be organic. And they just so happen to be vegan. And I don't have any kids...these cookies are for ME!!! I cook vegan food and was looking for some cookies for banana pudding. Haven't gotten around to making the pudding yet and the cookies are almost gone! Thank goodness for subscribe and save!
46227,B0007G9FD0,dog does not like it,Bought this for my dog that could stand losing some weight. Rescue dog. Only food I have given her that she does not like. Had to buy canned dog food to mix with it. That is the only way she will eat it. Probably will not be buying this type of food again.

49339,B000IHNCQO,Like eat packing peanuts with flavored salt,"Maybe the other flavors are better, but the nacho cheese flavor was terrible.  Bless those who gave it 5 stars for they have no tastebuds."
24528,B0016JJEFG,I think its low quality tea,"This tea has a completely different taste than ALL the other black teas out there....  It is reddish/orange in color, which is odd too....as most black teas are uniformly ""dark"".  It has, what I characterize, as a ""burnt tea"" flavor, even though I only steep it for 5 minutes max.<br /><br />I once bought an off brand Chinese tea and it too was ""red"" in color and had the same ""burnt"" taste.<br /><br />I think everyone here is confused.  Black tea should be black, not red.  This tea was also quite cheap at Whole Foods, only $3.99 for organic tea.  I have paid twice that for better tasting, BLACK, organic black tea.<br /><br />I'm pissed at the burnt flavor and red color.  I can barely stand it iced.  Will likely have to buy something else."
3875,B001M074MY,Parisian coffee blend,Parisian Cafe' was not may favorite blend for breakfast coffee.  I prefer others of the Melitta brand.
3246,B005K4Q1VI,Found the secret,"To everyone worried about not getting a full cup to run through your machine with these k-cups, here's the trick.  Put it in your machine, close the lid, open the lid, turn 90 degrees, close the lid and repeat two more times.  You should have closed the lid on the k-cup four times by now.  Next step is to hit the brew button.  The problem is the needle is too small to run the chocolate through.  With the extra three holes it all flows out very quick and turns out good.  Would have given them five stars if it was able to run through the needle like it is supposed to.  Could have been a little thicker overall, but not bad."
28515,B00122CN8C,Great,Always used in everything from fajitas to our own chicken chile. Superbowl<br />wouldn't have been the same without it
9241,B006N3IG4K,Wolfgang Puck Sumatra,I ordered this by accident and I'm so happy I did. This is a new favorite of mine. It's nice and strong without being bitter.
66953,B000KND8RY,Life saver!,Love agave! Doesn't make me feel like pooh when I eat it and no aftertaste like other sweetners (artificial).
244,B001EO5ZMY,This is what you get in the store,I have tried it out despite the other review and I found that this is exactly the same tea i buy in either Russian or Italian groceries.
1472,B0040WHJQM,Noodles not good,The noodles for this product are what make me gag.  I am not a fan of this meal at all and I &lt;3 Asian food.  For those looking for a delicious snack who are not already 100% vegan - I would either A) go try 1 first or B) skip buying this package as it is not delicious.
51903,B004XWB7XA,My Order Experience,"I ordered from this seller for the 1st time and I was definitely disappointed.  The dog food bag was very shabby looking and it only had 4 months before it expired.  That concerned me.  I contacted the seller and he replaced it with another, but the expiration date was exactly the same on the second bag.  I returned the second bag and I'm waiting for a credit on my account.  I would not order this item from this seller again. This item was ordered from Wag.com, not Amazon."

11588,B001E3TUGC,Low germination rates.,"These seeds are on the edge of their sell by date. (11/11)  Not very good for the small scale gardener who wants to save some for next year.  Germination rates are at about 1/4.  Too early to tell much about the plants, but I will update again if they do well."
2603,B001IZKD1W,Noticablely tastey!,"So... I usually consider pasta to be pasta to be pasta.  It's usually all the same to me.  HOWEVER... when I tried this brand of pasta, I noticed that it does taste better.  I can't describe how exactly, but it does.  I thought maybe it was my imagination (maybe knowing it's organic was influencing my judgment) but my sister commented on it when I served it for her one day.  She wanted to know where I got it - it tasted so good.  Hmmm.  So while usually there isn't much of a taste difference when it comes to noodles and pasta, for this brand there is.  It's subtle, but it's there.  When we moved from California I discovered they didn't sell it in the stores here in NY.  So I was elated when I found Amazon carries it.  Elated over a simple pasta?  Yes, that's how good it is in comparison!  Mmmmmm Mmmmm!"
2028,B001E5E29A,Pancake Mix the best!,This mix is the kids' and family favorite. It tastes like vanilla. It's wonderful for pancakes or waffles.

When testing the black cherry flavor, I had placed the can in the freezer for a short period, since I prefer drinks to be ice cold or hot; I didn't want lukewarm to get in the way of a positive response to the first sip.  As the drink warmed a bit, the sweetness overtook the carbonation, which is inevitable in a carbonated beverage, yet, due to the purity of the fruit base, the flavor remained true and welcome.<br /><br />When trying the kiwi flavor, I just had the drink chilled perfectly for me, no ice crystals.  I like the kiwi even better than the cherry!  The kiwi has more tang.  See below (or on the product description on the buying page) for the juice blends used.  I've noticed that most juices currently have apple and grape included, likely because those are cheaper to produce.<br /><br />The way the drink was promoted wasn't a lie!  It worked for me:<br /><br />1. ""100 % of what you want.  0% of what you don't want.""<br /><br />2. ""Make The Switch to a great tasting, all natural beverage that's the perfect balance between JUICE and CARBONATION.""<br /><br />3. The logo has ""THE"" placed upside-down and reversed, atop ""Switch,"" with a swirl designed around the words, the swirl imitating the symbol for reversing something.<br /><br />4. The ingredients read: ""100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola* [I added the asterisk; see below] and raspberry and strawberry juice concentrated), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C)""<br /><br />5. 100% juice carbonated.<br /><br />6. The can is smaller than the norm for soda pops, which I also liked, because when I used to drink sodas regularly, I usually opened a can and left half of it to get too warm (and fizzed out), so the remainder went down the drain (after I returned it to the fridge for a few days hoping I might drink it).  I drank the whole can of Black Cherry!<br /><br />I decided I liked the near slush state of a short stint in the freezer... leaving it too long, though, might cause too much separation of the fruit concentrate from the fizz water... and, of course, makes it undrinkable from the can until it melts enough to flow through the hole in the top.<br /><br />In the past, when I had begun wanting something more natural than most soda beverages (with phosphates, etc., added), I had used frozen orange juice concentrate added to Club Soda or Ginger ale.  It didn't take long to feel that the process was too much trouble (and it was more expensive than the cost of the Switch product).  Also, I like the types of fruits Switch is using.<br /><br />At first I was confused at the acerola* ingredient, not knowing what it was.  Since my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI"">Kindle 2: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)</a> was at hand, as always, I looked up acerola in the onboard dictionary.  The word wasn't in there, so I pushed the curser to the right, on the arrow for more types of searches, and used my standby, Google, and found several listings of acerola.<br /><br />Briefly, I found that it's thought to have originated from the Yucatan, and is known as Barbados cherry or wild crape myrtle, a tropical fruit-bearing shrub.  Reading into the variety of praiseworthy qualities of that cherry, I was impressed!  It has 32 times the amount of vitamin C as Orange juice, and many other healthful assets.  If you're interested in details, feel free to go Google.<br /><br />I'm beginning to think that many of the flavors available from Switch will include equally intriguing tropical fruits.  (I was glad to see that other flavors also have acerola in them).<br /><br />Though the can is appealing and fine, this beverage is good enough to deserve a designer bottle to appeal to the gourmet crowd who want flavor without true health issues... don't get me started on the myriad of heavy promotions of pseudo health issues.  I have a book in progress to be published on KINDLE, which will debut with steam hissing out of Kindle's ears, at no extra charge!  (I'll add a comment to this review about why I had quit drinking soda pops, which will explain why I will be happily able to welcome Switch into my diet.)<br /><br />My thanks to THE SWITCH for providing a healthy, gourmet quality drink... WITHOUT, thank God, SOYBEANS added!!<br /><br />I'm hooked!<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several Kindle books and Amazon Shorts<br /><br />P.S.<br />With chagrin and apologies I've had to add comment updates here"

I grew up using Melitta filters and still individually make each cup of coffee in a single cup filter. Generally I use pre ground coffee (so I am not a purist), although I occasionally grind my own.  I usually drink two cups of coffee a day.  Enough about my coffee habits.<br /><br />Melitta is a pretty trusted name in the coffee industry. and I expected this coffee to be be a quality product.  I was not disappointed with the coffee, although it was not quite as exciting as the regular vanilla flavored coffee I recently tried from Melitta.  The flavor was pretty strong and rich, although decaf always has a slight aftertaste, even with the Swiss Water process used for decaffeinating.  Generally. I drink regular coffee as my first choice, but I admit that I switch to decaf in the evening.<br /><br />I have no problem recommending this coffee as a second choice..."
23497,B004R8J8E0,Great on Chicken.,"They say this is for pork, but I actually like this flavor on chicken. It's a bit less salty than the traditional chicken flavor and goes well with chicken.  Just toss in bag, and bake according to instructions. It is very tasty, easy meal."

I have really enjoyed other Davidson's teas,many also containing flowers, and thought to try something new.  I think the last ingredient is where things went bad.  It was ""natural flavor""  which must have been rose oil or something since my tea chemical taste and making a weaker tea did not help at all."

7145,B004K30HO2,Disappointed,"Thought this might be a nice alternative to use with my favorite coffee, but was sadly disappointed.  It leaked all over - no matter what we tried and the coffee was weak, machine clogged with most attempts and water wouldn't brew thru.  At times the cup even melted a little - leaving a nasty taste in the coffee.<br /><br />Go with the greener alternative and try the ekobrew - much better results and no waste."
858,B000VKYKTG,Very Happy with Pocky Sticks,"Of the many purchses I made on Amazon this past December, I was most pleased with the Pocky Chocolate Cream Covered Biscuit Sticks (Pack of 10). They arrived on time, and they were a 'hit' as a surprised gift. Be sure to keep them refridgerated."

3472,B005K4Q1VI,Excellent Hot Chocholate,"Was skeptical about the quality of hot chocolate from a K cup but Grove Square is amazing.  It is just as good as making it from scratch but without the fuss.  The milk chocolate is mild, the dark has enough bite to make it interesting and the peppermint is perfect for after dinner."
76361,B001HTKOWC,Not great,"Very disappointed with the flavor, or lack therof.  Stash usually has dependable products, so this was a real letdown."
3451,B005K4Q1VI,SoSo,This hot chocolate is ok but not nearly as rich and smooth as the cafe escapes products.  We tried it out because they were less expensive but once they are al gone we'll be going back to the cafe escapes brand.
415555,B002T17T4I,Good buy.,These chili peppers are just what I needed for my salsa's. The only thing is that they are pricey. Will only buy from here when I can't find anywhere else.
7731,B001E5DZTS,Supplement infant feeding,"Now that my LO is exclusively formula fed, I use it once a day to supplement his feeds. He took to it after the first two feeds and now likes it very much.

411256,B0040WCR6O,Who is this from?,Nothing in the box saying who this is from. Who do I thank? Should have a card with the person's name on so I can thank them. How will they even know if I got it or not?

9205,B006N3IG4K,Good taste but secretly  DECAF,Taste is good but in my opinion coffee that has been decaffinated should be required to have such info clearly visible warning in big red letters before I mistakenly rely upon it to get me going in the morning.  Small print on the bottom of the box (I mean 6 point font) tells this.  Several mornings of splitting headaches could have been avoided . . . this caused me to check several other flavors online and none of them say anything one way or another about caffeine. I don't know how to avoid this for other products but this info should be clearly stated on every coffee for sale.
265993,B002DNX4GO,health,I like this product which was introduced to me in the hospital.  Now I drink it often.  I can take it instead of lunch.
3157,B003OZYUEA,Best water ever.,"I am a chemist, so I know about water, and why it can taste like heaven (e.g. it is tasteless), and why it can taste like sweat (e.g. ""mineral-enhanced.""). This water is expensive - cheap for online, but costly if you are a Walmart or Target shopper. However, I highly recommend you try this, if you want tasteless water. You see, when water is mineral enhanced, and its swirling around through the various protrusions and undulations the road provides in the summer heat, the water tends to build a certain taste, which some like, and others don't. I like my water tasteless. Therefore I recommend this product to those whom do not want H2O + minerals, but just plain water."
3177,B000FDKUSO,Suzie's Puffed Thin Cakes,"These are, without question, the best ""diet"" crackers I've ever had.  I've had them with and without salt and since I usually put peanut butter on them, I didn't need the salt.<br /><br />These are great for travel, for kids, and when you just need a very low-calorie cracker."
58367,B000EUICU6,Don't go here...,"I bought this hoping for at least an edible product. After following the directions to the ""T"" I ended up with a flat, soggy cake that I threw out after just a taste. And, this is not an inexpensive product.

85114,B0055ZU898,very good coffee,"If you're hooked on illy, as my wife and I are, this appears to be the cheapest way to obtain it: ~$33.33/kg. The same coffee in 1/4kg tins can run almost twice that."
743,B001BB3LW6,Dum Dums for all!!,I work in college Financial Aid and keep a bowl of these on my desk for the students.  I used to buy them in the grocery store then learned I could get them for less online ($17 for 3lb bag) and thought that was a good deal - until I found this GREAT deal!
1622,B001RVFDOO,Yummy Yummies,I really enjoy these low calorie chips.  They have a good flavor with a good crunch and are crisp.<br /><br />I was wondering if when ordering a case of these chips one could order their favorites and not the whole 6 flavors?  Say just 2 flavors if desired??<br /><br />Its a great product. don't stop manufacturing them.
60743,B003QNJYXM,Works almost too good,"I had always seen the commercials for these energy drinks, and being the skeptic I am never really paid them any attention. One of my friends came back from college over winter break and he drinks them quite often, so I figured why not give them a try.<br /><br />These things work well, almost too well really. I've been taking them because during the week between school and work I average about 5-6 hours of sleep. When the commercial says feel it in minutes, they were not lying. It gets me going so much it almost feels like I've taken (illicit) drugs. I have a hard time sitting still in class these are so powerful.<br /><br />I will note that some people seem to get nothing from these, so before you go out and buy 24 bottles I'd say head to a gas station and pick one up for about 3 bucks. Also, energy lovers out there who have a Costco membership, you can get a pack of 24 for about 36 dollars before tax, and skip out on the shipping time."
522260,B0013OVWPE,Commercial Product,"I got this for the MC Diet. Until I found out about private family owned companies that also provide a home made product. That's recommeneded, but if your just getting started you can start with this but FYI it wont be enough!!!"
7760,B001E5DZTS,great product!,My baby is allergic to cow's milk and this is so much cheaper and better than the hypoallergenic formula.  He loves this stuff!
43639,B000P0SCKK,Licorice tasted a little stale,"We really liked this licorice when it was sold in the store. It was the same exact brand, but a different container. We ordered some online when the store didn't carry it anymore. It was a little hard, stale and the flavor was off. Didn't taste the same. Seemed a little pricey as well for the product we received."

8462,B003VXFK44,This coffee is very good.,"I normally drink only Donut Shop, but when I saw this on sale I thought I would give it a try.  I was quite impressed with it and really enjoy this one.  I have now added it to my list of favorite K-cups to buy."
3529,B005TY2REE,No cholesterol. No Sodium. Not Very Sweet. Good Taste.,"In my trip through the health area of my local food market I stumbled upon Enjoy Life Boom Choco Boom Dark Chocolate Bar. I just can't resist trying things such as this. Into the cart it went. It's rather good. It says it's dairy, nut and soy free, and I'll take their word. The question is taste. Well, it's a good tasting bar. I have a couple others that I would regard higher. but this one is quite good. It's a bit high in calories (170 per bar) but has no cholesterol or sodium. Not bad. I'll pick it up again.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"

So when I saw this, I immediately bought it. However, this was NOTHING like jerky. It was squishy, and tasted like bread, and the supposed ""Teriyaki"" flavor was nothing like any Teriyaki flavor I've ever had. No one in my house will eat it, so I'm returning it. If you buy, I guarantee you'll be sorry."
358290,B0032CJPOK,"If you've got to use formula, use this one",Our baby likes this formula and we like that it's organic.  We use one bottle a day at bedtime to give her a boost of iron and DHA/ARA.

44160,B0007NOWMM,Flavorless French Vanilla,The only taste you will get from these pods are faint vanilla.  You need two pods to make a cup of coffee and even with the two pods it does not taste like coffee.  It tastes like watered down coffee with a fake vanilla flavoring.
3310,B005K4Q1VI,Perfect Cocoa,"Everyone in my family likes hot cocoa. I was running plain water through my k-cup maker and using hot cocoa from a canister but my kids didn't really get the right measurements and more often than not we would have overflow. So I decided to try this for my kids and it makes a perfect cup every time. No overflow. The taste is good, its creamy with enough cocoa to water ratio for my kids. I will be ordering this product from now on for my family.<br />In the interest of product comparison, we have ordered Timothy's white hot chocolate, and Green Mountain Hot cocoa, Timothy's was great, but pricy, and Green Mountain didn't really taste all that great to our family. It had a watered down taste to it."
14437,B00284TR82,Arrived undamaged,"I was a little hesitant to order due to the packaging concerns of others, but I did anyway.  They arrived today undamaged.  I had ordered some other items which were shipped together in a larger box, so that probably helped.  In other words the box the creamers were in was itself in a larger box.  I can see how a few might burst if they were roughly handled.  They are shipped loose in a box.  For the price though, I figured if a few burst I was still way ahead on price.  I give it 5 stars because you should already know about the product before you order (yummy!) and they were undamaged on this shipment."

73010,B004S07FZ6,DIS-GUST-ING,"I purchased these very large cans of chili because they were priced ridiculously cheaply at the time. I planned to split the cans up into smaller portions and freeze the smaller portions to make a large number of meals. The first can I opened looked a little different from other Hormel chili I have had in the past. The beans were all mashed up and there were large chunks of cubed meat in the chili. Normally the meat resembles little pieces of ground meat. These were weird unappetizing chunks. The chili had no chili taste. It tasted like slightly burned re-fried beans. The night after eating this and the next day, there were numerous trips to the bathroom. Won't give details - but it wasn't pleasant.<br />A few days later, I opened a second can hoping the first was just a one time thing. The second had the same mashed up beans and meat chunks. I tossed it and now have four large cans of chili that I will never use.<br />Maybe this was just a bad batch. It almost seems as if they scraped the old chili residue off of their pots, threw in some leftover meat chunks, canned it and sent it to me. Needless to say, I will never purchase this product again."
7681,B001E5DZTS,So Far - Great for Colic!,"Our little baby girl battled colic and reflux for nearly 6 weeks. She was unable to sleep because her little belly hurt - she would be 90% asleep when she would arch her back ad then scream in pain. Baby, mommy, and daddy were all miserable. After going through all the brands of formula (including <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ARPKE4"">Similac Alimentum Hypoallergenic Formula, Powder, Case of 6 Cans- each 1 lb (454 g)</a>) the doctor finally put her on goat's milk and Prilosec. I am not sure which was the bigger influence, but the quality of our lives is now significantly better.<br /><br />  The nice thing about the Meyenberg Goat Milk is that is easy to prepare just like regular formula. Liquid goat's milk must be kept in the refrigerator and must be warmed ... not too big of a deal except for those 3am feedings! Another nice thing about the Meyenberg powdered milk is that folic acid is added. Remember that if you choose to give goat's milk to your baby that you will need to give some supplemental vitamins. Our daughter seems to enjoy the taste - and as a bonus it does not have the nasty smell of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ARPKE4"">Similac Alimentum Hypoallergenic Formula, Powder, Case of 6 Cans- each 1 lb (454 g)</a>.<br /><br />Final Verdict - So far... great... let's hope it continues!<br /><br />5 Stars"

It finally dawned on me that due to throwing up bile in the am was that the food was not staying with her.  I even tried feeding her before going to bed at night and still did not work.  I tried Evo and I could not believe the change.  She does not get us up at night to go outside.  She was having 3-4 bowel movements every day and now she has 1 or sometimes 2.  I have had her on the Evo large bites for almost a year now and she has not been sick once.  It is the higher protein in this food that stays with her longer and has made all of our lives so much better.  Thank you, thank you EVO!!!"
3635,B004SCD4NG,graet find,this product came as advertized..it was a great buy and I love the taste of the tea<br /><br />great deal and happy i purchase from them.
76539,B001B0W0W4,My cat tore the squeaky mouse apart in a few hours,"I really wanted to like this toy. If it didn't have small batteries and brittle plastic inside the mouse I would probably give it two stars, as I can still use the string and the thing that goes over the top of the door with some less dangerous toy tied to it. But at this point I'm watching my cat closely, hoping he didn't swallow one of the batteries or some of the other parts that caused the mouse to squeak so realistically."
77268,B000VK339Y,Great Ingredients,"I have been cooking for my dog since before the pet food scare, that gets to be too much at times when you have other things to do or aren't feeling well, I have been feeding the dry Newmans for 3 years but have a spoiled cocker who has to have a little 'something' in with her dry.....this canned food drives her crazy, she just loves it, must be the whitefish in. She gets a teaspoon or so in with her dry & cleans the bowl...Amazons price beats that big box store when you use subscribe & save."
23368,B000X9NRKS,Dog loves them,Dog loves them! She is sad when we are out of them and can't wait for the next batch to come.
6354,B001AW9PTO,much yum,"A coworker brought this yummyness into the office and I am so greatful.  I am not big beef jerky fan but this stuff totally falls under my ""much yum"" category."
8541,B003VXFK44,A little too much bitterness & acid,"This is less of a ""bold"" flavor and more of an acidic and bitter coffee. My wife is easy to please and she's not a fan. I'll finish the box but I reach of others first."
232095,B0079LP198,I Highly recommended.,"I Highly recommended."". Hei, customer!! If you like fragmentatized chips, this is the product for you. If you like to eat chips with a small spoon? You can not miss any of those."
177317,B006ZP9RJY,A++++++++,i just want to elev a review not all of this i got it it is what i wanted thank you
3548,B005ZHJI9C,Great and good price!,"I love these noodles.  They are really great for a midnight snack.  It's not really something that will fill you up for a dinner.  If you do eat it for dinner, you will be hungry later.  Maybe some people wouldn't!!!!  But, it just doesn't stick to my ribs.  I love them though and Amazon has a really good price."
542531,B001E50WDA,"Good product, but be wary of the hidden calories and carbs","This so called ""No Calorie Sweetener"" does indeed have calories!  According to the Splenda website, one cup of Splenda has 96 calories and 24 grams of carbohydrates.<br /><br />If you want a sweetener for baking, use a liquid Sucralose sweetener."
513172,B001A5WSMC,Roland feng shui edamame,"I thought they were Japanese edamame, but they were from China and I do not eat food products from China, so I gave them away"
73837,B001LQTJNQ,SIXTY SIX PERCENT SUGAR Very Little Nutritional Value,"First, with a Name like, ""Floridas's Natural"" I thought maybe they were made with fruit from, I don't know, FLORIDA!!!  Wrong! they are made in China. Aside from that, imagine a giant gummi bear run over by a steam roller.  These are not fruit leather, they are traslucent, molded strips of evaporated fruit juice that have 0% daily fiber, are 66% sugar by weight and have almost no nutritional value."
304746,B004XLC2BW,Milo's Kitchen Beef Sausage Slices with Rice,While I like the idea of Milo's Kitchen I found that the ingredients in the product raise some questions about the health risks to my Rottie.  There are onions and such that could cause harm to my pet so with that said I don't believe I will be purchasing this item again.
3437,B005K4Q1VI,It's decent...,"This is okay cocoa. It's not really very smooth, and it's a little watery. I had high hopes, as I love dark chocolate hot cocoa, and the reviews were good. I will finish the box I bought, but will try another brand next time."
156398,B000633Z8A,Great,My puppy loves these things. Although I didn't realize they were lungs. The one thing is that I wish that they would have lasted longer.
7205,B000ES3LMC,love for earl grey,I spent along time and a lot of money looking for a great Earl Grey... to this point its been loose leaf tea i order from another site until my girl friend went to London with her family bring me back a small sample pack of 10 tea bags. i loved it so much i had gotten this 6 pack of 20 count boxes which i have polished off and reordered since then.<br /><br />The tea stays fresh in the foil package each tea bag  which makes it so air and light cant damage the flavor of the tea which is the problem is loose leaf tea's.<br /><br />The flavor of the tea is a nice Bergamot flavor which is smooth no matter how long you leave the tea in. i perfer mine strong and straight up. each sit is as good as the first. i will keep buying this tea and also try other ones by ahmad of London
3686,B000ER1DIM,All she ever wants to eat,My little girl will ask for these crackers day and night.  Bought a pkg of 6 and have used up 4 real quick.  I will be back for more very soon.
67546,B002XQ4KDC,expensive but great treats,"my dog loves this treat and it's made in the USA, but it's a really small bag and very pricey"
81230,B00018CWZC,Hanu,The peas are way too salty to eat I talked to the owner she did't care about the condition of the peas.
18896,B003FSPWXY,fancy hamburger helper,"this product is tasty. You add a half lb of ground beef, 2 cups milk, and some water. It is very much like Hamburger Helper but with less processed ingredients and whole wheat pasta mix. It takes a few minutes to thicken after cooking, the sauce is thin before it sits. Overall, I like the smaller packaging and that it uses ingredients that I can read and understand."
76726,B0049ULB78,Ridiculous Price,"This item is way over priced.  Don't pay $1 / cup.  You can get it around $0.60 / cup anywhere else online.  If you are paying $1 / cup, you might as well go to Dunkin Donuts."
21688,B002BCD2GO,Expired Product,We received the product in a timely manner after placing the order but it was expired when it arrived based on the date stamped on the neck of the bottles.
241271,B001TM3XHU,Cirque de la Mer,"Cirque de la Mer is a sea food stew.  A mix of fish and vegetables.  This food is not all ground up like some processed dogs foods.  You can actually see the chunks of fish, carrots, peas, etc."
31605,B000E4AKQ6,Great for a sore throat,"My mom gave me licorice tea whenever I had a bad throat, and it really was soothing to my throat.  This works just as well!<br /><br />Now, if you really really dislike the flavor of licorice, you might want to stay away from this tea.  I don't typically like licorice (I can tolerate it), but this isn't too bad.  Sometimes I drink it just for the scent and flavor."
555599,B00473RVSA,Like the Way it tastes,"I like it, but I just don't seem to care to buy it again.  I have to devide it, Stick to my Hunt's Pudding"
45697,B0041NYV8E,Didn't tickle my taste buds,"Although touted as an all natural beverage, it did not taste that way. I caught what seemed a taste of an artificial sweetener. The maker says it is sweetened by honey, glucose and sucrose. Not anything artificial there. My tongue must have misled me.<br /><br />It matters little, though, since I did not like the taste. I'm fond of ginger, of honey, and of lemon in hot drinks. So I thought this one would tickle my taste buds. But no."
3355,B005K4Q1VI,YUM!,Grove Square Milk Chocolate Cocoa k cups are great! I usually make hot cocoa from scratch with milk over the stove. I thought this was easier and delicious. To add creaminess I put in either a splash of milk or a shot of whipped cream--perfect!
8621,B003VXFK44,Nice flavour,"I like this coffee, its nice to drink it in the morning. It has medium body and full flavour. Goes great with raw sugar and splash of non fat milk."
35895,B000LKXJEI,"Hard to open and messy, but good..........","This is the only veggie jerquee my local grocery store carries and is a good substitute for when I don't feel like ordering my favorite(stonewalls) online.<br />I like the flavor and the texture but I always need scissors to open the package and I hate the thought of my germy scissors touching my food.<br />Once you finally open it, it's hard to really get a good bite because it is very stringy and full of sauce, you usually end up with half the product in one bite just so you don't get sauce all over your hands and mouth.<br />I often get it stuck in my teeth too, which is annoying when I'm at work without dental floss.<br />I think they are redesigning the package so hopefully it will be easier to eat soon. They could work on the price too, $1.29 at the store for 2 bites is a bit ridiculous!"
40546,B00020HHRW,Disgusting!,This tea tastes nasty.  Maybe I just dont like sage but it made me gag!
508482,B0002H3TB8,Not so good,"The dog treat arrived almost powdered, rather than in nuggets, so I have given it to my dogs over their feed rather than as the training treat I intended."
46411,B002GJ9JWS,No basic directions,"I made a peanut sauce with this and it was very good though not as smooth as with real PB. My beef with it is the lack of basic instructions on how much powder and water to use to make basic peanut butter.- there are recipes other website but not specific guidance on the mix you would use if just substituting peanut butter. Am I an idiot? Maybe... Still, if you need 2Tbs of peanut butter you will use almost 4 Tbs. I have only used it once so did not get good measurements because there was lots of adding more water or powder and also I usually weigh ingredients and as another reviewer pointed out the weight and volume on the label didn't match. This of course affects the calories and if you are counting them this matters to you.<br />I read reviews about price and didn't think much of it- it didn't seem that bad for a jar of PB but in a recipe that used 1/2c of PB I used at least 1/3rd of the jar so yeah, kinda pricey... It is what it is and I won't knock a star off but just keep in mind that this does not make a jar of PB which should have been obvious but then maybe I'm an idiot!"
51064,B001TM711E,Dog Luvers dream,"If you have a dog that is a picky eater, well this is the dog food for you.  The local pet store can't even keep this stuff on the shelf.  My dog loves the Jammin Salmon too."
4897,B004JWS0CA,"Full flavor, non-acidic, best K-cup so far!","I have been experimenting with K-cup brews for almost 2 years now.  I tried Timothy's Colombia Excelencia ONLY because it was on sale and I was still looking for THE ONE.  Well, I finally found it.  Columbia Excelencia is the best breakfast coffee I have found to date.  Rich, full-bodied, with a clean non-acrid finish.  It goes well with milk and Splenda, no odd aftertaste whatsoever.  Donut shop is my favorite over ICE, Newman's Nantucket is my favorite BOLD, Timothy's Italian goes best with dessert, and Colombia Excelencia is the first thing I drink every morning."
2845,B0085G4ACA,My afternoon pick-up,"I love the Pineapple/Coconut water. It is high in potassium. I am a rural mail carrier and have to be out in the hot weather. In the afternoon I get hot, dry, and thirsty. I am trying to lose weight so I'm watching my calories. Water is wet and cold but doesn't quench my thirst. This stuff does the trick. It quenches my thirst and gives me a little pick-up for the afternoon and keeps me going. This only has 60 calories per serving, so that is much less than a 180 calorie Gatorade. I recommend this to those looking for a healthy alternative to the sugary sports drinks."
16136,B001EO5O9I,So So Coffee,"I bought this because the store was out of my brand.  I was disappointed with this coffee.  Not very flavorful, and the flavor is just ok.  Wouldn't buy again."
76371,B001HTKOWC,Does anyone else on Amazon know what green tea is supposed to taste like?,"Im not sure what everyone else on here thinks green tea is supposed to taste like, but this is not it. I go through about half a gallon of green tea a day, so Im always willing to try new flavors, brands, etc. This is the only one that I have had to literally choke down. This tea is bitter, but thats not the real reason its so bad. The taste is cheap, overpowering, and unpleasant.<br /><br />I think either Stash has its employees writing reviews, or amazonians are being suckered in by the snazzy/hip box and packets of this truly awful tea."
304385,B001AS1A4Q,It Works,"I really like the 5 hr Energy because it has no caffeine, no sugar and it works.  I like the fact that it has vitamins in it.  It helps get me over the last few hours of work when I start feeling sluggish."
42616,B001EQ4E60,Worst Packaging EVER!,"The product itself is fine but the packaging is terrible.  When I received my package, the lid on one jar was cracked and another jar was smashed into a million little pieces.  Instead of taking an extra 20 seconds and wrapping each jar in bubble wrap, some genius threw all six jars into the box then covered it with a single plastic air bag.  Looking at the other reviews, it sounds like this is a common problem.  I would strongly advise not buying this product unless you like playing with broken glass."
5528,B001HTPA3K,Uuuuum.....,"I LOVE green tea and green tea beverages. When I saw this on sale I was happy to try it. Once I received it and tasted it I was not so happy. First off tasted like the smell of dirty water. Best way I can describe it lol This has cane juice yet tastes like it doesn't have anything. Added calories for what no flavor? No Thanks. So yeah all in all pretty flavorless (beside the dirty water smell taste). Was a huge disappointment. Worse yet I bought 2-12 pk cases. Now I have to doctor the rest up. Maybe just buy some lemons and make them into a green tea lemonade? Oh well, I tried."
70895,B000E4ALGK,Nearly awful.,"With all the natural, organic ingredients, I can't see how they came up with such a bland, unpalatable product.  Not sweet enough, and a bitter aftertaste as well.  Maybe it's just me, but I would not recommend this particular flavor to anyone."
45757,B0041NYV8E,Interesting,"I would totally drink this if I were sick.  It has that natural medicine taste, almost reminding me of lemon Theraflu. I'm not sure if that's an insult to this product, or a compliment to Theraflu.  It has a strong ginger flavor with an under-taste of lemon.<br /><br />The instructions are in English, French, and Spanish.  Note, 250ml is equivalent to 1 cup of water - all the instructions are in metric.  The drink is just mixed  with hot water, not unlike instant coffee.<br /><br />I received this sample from the Amazon Vine program.  The sample did not come with ingredients, or any marketing information.<br /><br />I would be more likely to drink this product if it were marketed as a health drink.  It isn't bad, but I wouldn't drink it for pleasure."
1922,B0016PKA1C,"keeps herbs fresh, looks nice--awkward to use","I've had a couple of these for a few years but find that I don't use them all that often because their size & design limits their usefulness. For bushy herbs like cilantro or parsley it only holds a small bunch, and it's difficult to keep the bunch together while you snap the lid back on. Since the bottom cup is so shallow herbs tend to flop out the front unless you lay the pod down when first filling it. It works great for asparagus, but only for small-ish bunches and if the spears aren't too tall.<br /><br />More often than not I simply use a canning jar + 1/2"" of water with a plastic bag over the top, which keeps the contents just as fresh and allows for easier access. These pods do look much nicer in the fridge than a bag-topped-jar, however, and the clear front makes it harder to forget what's in there.<br /><br />They are definitely well made and not prone to leaking or tipping over. And the little drain port is fun to use.<br /><br />But it only works for small bunches."
352233,B001ELL3LE,The Juice is from CONCENTRATE,"In the description online the ingredients reads as follows:<br /><br />Ingredients<br />Cranberry Juice, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)<br /><br />The actual ingredients listed on the bottle are:<br />Cranberry Juice (Filtered Water, Cranberry Juice Concentrate) Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)<br /><br />There is a difference between Cranberry Juice and Cranberry Juice from concentrate.<br /><br />I will not buy it again."
284971,B000HDKWZI,salad dressing,"tried to find it locally , no luck.<br />found it online and rcvd it in 4 days."
506400,B001C15JCU,Stale and unusable,"I've used this product by this manufacturer before.  The item came from the seller stale and dried out.  We had to throw the entire package out.  I'm giving two stars only because the product is good when fresh,the problem was with the seller.  Do not buy from DAB Nutrition."
32383,B001AJ1ULS,Beware.... sudden change in product,"We have been ordering these chicken jerky treats for a long time with Amazon subscribe and save. My Boston Terriers really love them and get very excited to get their treat every morning. When I opened a bag from my most recent shipment, my dogs refused to take the treat from my hand. They took one sniff and backed away. My son's Lab got very sick from chicken jerky made in China and his vet told him to only buy treats made in the U.S.and I'm going to follow that advice."
372,B002O3VHXU,My favorite,Green Mountain is my favorite brand. Nantucket is my favorite coffee from Green Mountain. Very smooth flavor. Not too strong and not too weak.
30380,B005DDCKJ8,low carb?,"can someone please tell me how the ""four net carbs"" on the amazon header page (before you buy it) translates into the 28 carbs on the outside of the box per bar once it arrives?  Are we being lied to?"
77074,B001OCKIP0,"Tasty granola, reliable source","I have been a fan of this granola for about a year - I add it to a cup of vanilla soy yogurt for breakfast. It is a tasty, hearty granola. I don't think there is puffed rice filler, just oat clusters and chocolate pieces. This granola flavor is regularly out of stock at my local grocery store and find Amazon's subscription service extremely convenient."
105472,B000V18TQU,"Great, easy meal","You throw the paste in a pan with water and fish.  Simmer for 10 min.  Done.  Amazing.<br /><br />If you don't like spicy, this isn't for you."
2117,B00061EXBU,wow this stuff is incredible!,"you won't BELIEVE how many ways this product has saved my life!  I only gave it one star because i'm so dehydrated from drinking regular water all week because i ran out of money before my penta ran out.  when i can afford another shipment, i'll jack it back up to 5 STARS!<br />seriously, folks-- SOME waters just run through your system and you pee them all out right away.  not PENTA! it sticks to your ribs like oatmeal, restoring your body's natural tendencies to develop sympathetic electrolytic rehydration.  but it won't weigh you down!<br />other things i have noticed about this product:<br /><br />I accidentally dropped my cell phone into a glass of it, and when i pulled it out, it had better reception!<br />I was going to discipline my kids after they tried to clean my computer with it, until i discovered that it IMPROVED its functionality!<br />I threw some jumping beans into the bottle, and the next day i had a pair of baby pogo sticks growing in my refrigerator!<br /><br />hey, if you fill up your solar shower with this stuff, you won't even need soap.  it comes at a price, but it's so super!<br /><br />If you are tired with the uninvigorating, boring old swill other people call ""water"", or are lethargic from all that unenhanced blah that's so bad they can't attach a higher market value to, and you're so over the cheap, readily available and monitored CRAP your McBurbia proffers, then look no further."
5915,B001DIM8K8,You have to be Irish to appreciate this,"I like it, it reminds me of food from my childhood. Not something I'd eat everyday.  Kinda like the way I feel about grits. You need to cook them for a long time. How you serve them makes all the difference in the world.  Great for baking, but you have to know the product before you try baking with it.  Taste?  Real wholesome, good stick to your ribs food, takes some effort like granola. Healthy eating?  Yes."
1631,B001RVFDOO,Popchips Review,Popchips is a new product for me--ordered after seeing an ad in Weight Watchers magazine.  Loved the product.  Packing was perfect.  Shipping went fine.  No complaints with this order at all.  Probably will order again soon!
440494,B002ZOCEMG,Love this coffee,"How can you complain?  It's cheaper than the grocery store and shipped to my door. Well, I could ask for a pack of 5."
89879,B002LANN56,Dog Picks Out Meat Pieces,"When presented with this food, my dog picked out the meat pieces leaving behind the rest. She sometimes leaves the vegetable pieces laying around the house and I have to pick them up. I throw them away because she refuses to eat them. She only continues to make a mess with them. This is not a dog food I would purchase on a regular basis for my dog. However, I gave it 3 stars because she is a picky eater to begin with, and the fact that she ate some of it was good. She will not even touch Science Diet. I even tried mixing Science Diet with other dog foods and she would spit the Science Diet pieces out. Also, a former dog of mine ate Chef Michael's on a regular basis but not this flavor. She liked chicken and filet minion. I would suggest those flavors over this one."
2370,B001LQTDBE,"Good dessert for someone gluten sensitive, dairy sensitive and diabetic","My husband is gluten sensitive, dairy sensitive, and diabetic, so it is very difficult to find desserts for him.  Usually, if it's gluten free, it has waaaay too much sugar, for example.  I tried a box of these cookies for him.  He tried them and said that they are surprisingly good.<br /><br />They are not mereingues, even though they are shaped like those types of cookies.  They are regular cookie consistency.  There are just a few in a package, so they are rather expensive.  However, they are less expensive than buying all the materials yourself and having them fail.  (Can you tell I have made some bombs in my time as a specialty cook? LOL)"
507491,B0036QKYD8,dates are good but expensive,$10 per pound? it's double price. check arabic/muslim stores they all have same dates in same box for around 5-6 dollars per pound.
28363,B000YUOY30,Love this creamer,This creamer goes well with my coffee after having it once I could<br />not stop buying it I think it is my favorite it does not need to be<br />cooled it compliments your coffee in a way that make it taste like a  5.00<br />dollar cup I use it with my k-cup maker you can not go wrong with this creamer!
81704,B001VDXO3K,Once was enough for me!,This is the only time I will order this.  I like coconut and I like water but this stuff is nasty.  Maybe I got a bad batch or something but I won't make that mistake twice.
44013,B0031U9VI8,Wrong Iron content information,"I can only echo other parents - I have been buying this product only because of the Iron content shown on the package. My daughter actually hates the flavor, but I was trying to make her eat a pouch every other day hoping it will keep her iron levels high. Very disappointed that this mistake wasn't announced or anyhow made noticable; I found out about it just by luck - was bragging about these pouches and showing the iron information to my parents, and noticed that the last shipment (I have it on subscribe and save) has only 4% of Iron listed on the pouch."
49842,B000SATILO,Great flavor!,I just finished my first bag of this tea. I decided to try a brand of 100% hibiscus and was very disappointed.  I enjoy the flavors mixed in this tea.  I tried adding my own cinnamon and orange peel to the other brand but it does not come close to the flavor of this tea.  I gave up and ordered this again.  I might experiment and mix some of it with the 100% brand since I hate to waste that non-flavorful tea.
45976,B000G1KNU0,Will make your stomach hurt,"Nasty. The leaves are so mushy, the stuffing (rice) is tastes awful and bitter. Your stomach will hurt. Don't bother buying."
8170,B000E1588O,If you like cinnamon!,"Delicious, flavorful tea.  A must for cinnamon lovers.  It also has a pleasant sweetness that even those of us who don't use sweeteners can enjoy. Wonderful as a hot drink, but I especially like it as a cold drink."
275185,B000CQID7E,Doesn't Taste Live Vanilla,"I cannot detect any vanilla flavor at all in this tea, instead it tastes like cloves."
8415,B003VXFK44,Tastes great,I bought a small 3 pack of this locally and liked it so much I bought the 48 pack.  Great deal on Amazon.
72318,B001E53UTS,Great flavor.  Too bad it contains aspartame.,"Sadly, I did not realize before I purchased this that it contains aspartame.  For that reason, I wouldn't buy it again.  The flavor is great.  I like it better than the raspberry/lime flavor.  But aspartame is very bad for you, and they should just label this stuff Lipton Powdered Rat Poison."
115008,B0018CJYL0,My cat says no.,My cat will only eat this if there is nothing else. However my dog likes it. The dog is always eating the cats left overs.
36103,B000U676C4,Saladitos,The packages should have been 2.4 oz and the packages that we received were only 1.2 oz.

26438,B000EF3E72,bad to the bone,take a cup of salt water add smoke and drink it that how bad it was in my opinion yepper full of salt
5909,B001DIM8K8,Best Oatmeal Ever!,This is the only oatmeal that my family will even consider eating.  I make it in the crock pot overnight and it is always ready when we are.  I use my small crock pot for the two of us.  I start with a 1/2 cup of oatmeal; add a dash of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla; add a 1/2 cup of milk and 2 cups cold water.  Place the lid on the crock pot and plug it in.  It will be ready in the morning when you are.  I let mine cook approx 10 hours.  My small crock pot has no settings- just off or on.  We love to add some brown sugar and dried blueberries or Craisins at the table.
61714,B001E5DRWI,It's not real black sesame,These seeds smell bad and fade in water. It turns pure water into black ink. I highly doubt the safty of this product. Try to avoid these weired seeds.
524561,B001T7MJO8,Cloying,"Well executed but cloying and saccharine.<br /><br />""The Cross"" was an instrument of torture, and at the end the deposition it was coated with blood and excrement.<br /><br />Hard for me to swallow it as a cookie, but then again some folks ""Christianity"" begins and ends in sentiment."
117493,B0016B7Z32,Mom swears by it,"This was a gift for mom who had run out.  She swears by it for calming her stomach, says it still works."
18686,B00008JOL0,These really work!,"I bought these for my 13 year old pug, who has very bad hips and arthritis, and very few teeth.<br /><br />Poor ole girl, she's a sweetheart, but getting around was hard on her.  These are soft, so she can chew them with no problem, and while she's still stiff if she's been sleeping a long time, she loosens right up once she starts moving.<br /><br />She was on Metacam, which worked just about the same, but is waaaay more expensive.  I love that these are made in the USA and part of the profits are donated to the Dog and Cat Research Fund.  These are just a win-win-win all around for us!<br /><br />Almost for got to mention....she loves them!"
353926,B000F0C56M,This was good quinoa at a fair price,"On the South Beach diet, we are not allowed rice or pasta, but we can have Quinoa, which, interestingly, is not a grain, but a berry.  In any case, it is very versatile and we have it around four times a week (have to, now that I've bought 32 pounds!).  My family loves it and that makes my life easier."
9185,B006N3IG4K,I really like this one!,"Taste is a personal thing, isn't it.  So I'll just tell you(as a gauge) my all time favorite K-cup is Timothy's Midnight Magic a ""california roast"" (which is dark). I'm partial to dark roasts and probably would not have even bothered with this Sorrento, but a friend had it, so I tried it, and lo and behold - I'm very glad I did. I find this blend even better than Puck's ""Kopei Ray"" which is his dark roast. There's a whole lot of good flavor here - the word ""luscious"" comes to mind. This one's not available every where and comes at a slight cost premium. I say it's worth it. These will be a regular for me. PS: A suggestion (which seems apparent); as with any k-cup, when you try a new blend, use the plain old 1 cup setting to check it out undiluted the first time."
5013,B000HDKZDC,Best cereal bars on the planet,"We use these for our daughter for a few reasons. One, they are healthier than other cereal bars on the market (whole grain). Two, they have yogurt incorporated into the bar. Three, the are thick and do not easily crumble. Since our daughter starting eating them when she was about 1, not having to clean up after she's eaten them is a BIG plus.<br /><br />Plus, they are super yummy for adults too.<br /><br />They are more expensive than others on the market (esp since I can get Nutrigrain bars in bulk at a discount) but they are worth it. Makes our life easier and they don't have a ton of added sugars!"
40449,B003Y3F5EQ,Decent,"It's not the best or the worst.  It does make my sweet boys poop smell horrible, maybe it's the cheese."
24747,B0036VFWO4,Terrible - Chicken??,The soup taste terrible.  The picture with big chunks of chicken is extremely misleading. There is almost no chicken in the soup.
381,B003YXWAF8,Disappointing,"The spicy version of this ketchup isn't bad, but it is too expensive.  The regular version is sweet as dessert.  Horrible.  Annie's Organic has a much better flavor and costs a lot less.  Even Heinz organic is a better deal.  I gave it three stars instead of two because it is in glass, not plastic."
3408,B005K4Q1VI,Grove Square K-cups,We recieved the product on time and in excellent shape. It tastes good and meets our expectations. Thanks for the excellent service.
3460,B005K4Q1VI,Delish,"My whole family loves this product, often times we struggle to find something like this that we can all have (some members of my family have severe nut allergies).  This product is nut free and clearly states what the ingredients are."
410229,B000084EZ4,Very disappointed,The cans arrived all banged up.  I will never order from this company again.
540,B000G6RYNE,C H I P.....C H I P.....H O O R A Y....!!!!!  :  )  ( B A C K Y A R D.....B A R B E C U E ),"I was getting VERY worried, when I read some of the other reviews here.  Specifically, the ""One Star"" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it.<br /><br />WOW!  They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.<br /><br />Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed.<br />But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS!  Amazon, in it's deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!<br /><br />Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we're all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of ""United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers""....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that these<br />different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the ""Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum""! : )<br /><br />I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious!  (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!<br />These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours<br />(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)<br /><br />The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:<br /><br />Potatoes<br />Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),<br />Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),<br />Rice Powder<br />Sugar<br />Salt<br />Onion Powder<br />Tomato Powder<br />Paprika<br />Torula Yeast<br />Garlic Powder<br />Chili Pepper<br />Citric Acid<br />Cayenne Pepper<br />Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour)<br />Natural Smoke Flavour<br /><br />Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!<br /><br />Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.<br />Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production<br /><br />As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this<br />can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!<br /><br />Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a ""Potato Chip Diet"".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I'd like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I've taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )<br /><br />These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,<br />are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn't like to eat.  These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the VERY first favourite, of all!<br /><br />Flavoured potato PERFECTION!"
30408,B003X7S45U,flavor lacking,"This seems to me to be strictly pumpkin pie spice, very weak, and i can not taste the vanilla.Sorry but it seems to me to have missed the mark."
47977,B004SRH2B6,This tastes aweful,"Anyone who says this tastes like choc milk or Yoo Hoo is nuts. I had it over ice and could hardly get it down. I wanted to like it and am extremely disappointed that it is so bad tasting. Delivery was not what I expected either. It came in a box with many other items, it was way too heavy and the box was ripped to shreds. I think the UPS guy carried it to my door like a basket and everything fell out. I guess the good news is it came quickly, along with the disappointment."
44125,B0007NOWMM,addicted,have become addicted to this particular flavor - it's what gets me out of bed in the morning.
5033,B001EO6BCC,Very poor service,"I would agree with the other poor ratings for Royal Oak - very poor customer service from Royal Oak. We ordered, this year, the exact same product as last year. When it arrived, the nuts were not the same product, and they would not refund or pay shipping for the return. Also, they only operate the few weeks that peanuts are 'in season.' Otherwise, emails and phone calls are not even acknowledged."
5199,B003R0LKSG,Excellent Grain-Free Option,"We recently adopted a new kitten. We rotate Felidae grain-free canned formula with Wellness Turkey canned food. He loves both and eats well, he's never left a single whole pea behind. This is a very high-quality cat food, using excellent all-meat proteins. He is healthy, active,affectionate, and has a smooth glossy coat. Definitely worth the cost in the long run.<br /><br />I believe it is worthwhile to rotate different (high-quality) canned foods for variety and to not create a cat who will ONLY eat one brand. I think this is useful also in the event of a recall. I'm looking for a 3rd high-quality brand to add to the rotation."
514023,B003PPDFBS,Made in China,Nothing on the website or on Amazon.com let us know these treats are made in China.  We do not feed our dogs any treats made in China!
7475,B000143ZK2,"I'm diabetic, and thank GOODNESS for Grandpa Po!","I've tried every one of this line of products and I have to say, I'm blown away by just how satisfying they all are. Not too much, not too little, every recipe falls within my personal taste parameters, as well as everyone I know who has tried 'em, for that matter.  The ratio of carbs to protein, the low sodium, etc., makes this a VERY attractive snack to me because I'm diabetic.  It's why I'm compelled to write a review. It's REALLY hard satisfying some of the cravings a diabetic gets. We LOVE our carbs, but it's SO hard finding low-carb snacks that give the same satisfaction as, say, a loaf of bread, or crunchy sweets, etc. The Grandpa Po line literally saves my a** because too often I ""cheat"" on stuff that drives up my blood glucose, and that is VERY bad. So, a handful of this stuff LITERALLY is a benefit to my health. Fellow diabetics, TAKE NOTE!"
48887,B000EHP62G,Best Protein Bars!,"No matter how big or small of a lunch I eat and regardless whether I eat breakfast, I always feel my blood sugar drop between 3 and 4 pm everyday.  I keep these bars in my desk at work, in my gym bag, in my purse, anywhere I might be when I need that burst of energy.  This has become my daily staple, a snack that gets me through my workout and to dinner.  I strongly recommend."
6576,B003AYL9NU,dogs didn't like it,"I had high hopes for this product, because it is healthy and affordable.  But neither of my 2 Chihuahuas liked it; one just sniffed at it and walked away; the other dog chewed on it for a short while and then walked away from it.  One dog likes <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KUO2XS"">Nylabone Nutri Dent Original Minichews for Mini Dogs, 72-Count Pouch</a>, and the other dog likes <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004B3W4N8"">6"" BULLY STICKS - Free Range Standard Regular Thick Select 6 inch (10 Pack), by Downtown Pet Supply</a>.  I was looking for some alternatives that were healthy and more affordable.  I guess I'll be sticking with their current treats for now."
23314,B001E96JY2,Flavorless Goop,"After enjoying my first four Fresh Mixer varieties I had high hopes for this one as well.  Unfortunately, this one fell flat.  The sauce lacks flavor and the dish was somewhat sickening.  Having ordered a box of six, I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the others.  This one would be better off as dog food.  I do recommend the Zesty Marinara Penne, Rotini Meat Sauce and Southwestern Chicken though."
103796,B001E5E2R2,Great,"I received the product on time, deliverd to me just as promised. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for tea flavoring."
2621,B0016FY6H6,No Flavor - Not Authentic,"I have been drinking green tea powder for a few years and have come to love the slightly bitter and tannic flavor of it. I decided to try the Stash brand instead of my normal Japanese brand, and it's not even in the same universe. The Stash product is just green colored powder with no flavor at all. Seriously, the Stash brand uses a maltodextrin base and it has dehydrated tea added to it. Real, authentic green tea powder is supposed to be 100% tea, with no additives!<br /><br />If you drink a lot of green tea, you will be very disappointed with the Stash product. I strongly recommend you go with a Japanese brand that contains 100% tea ONLY.<br /><br />I tried to return it to Amazon, but they don't allow grocery items to be returned!"
2290,B002MB2J6I,"Delicious, nutrient-packed, fast--","I buy these through the ship-and-save program because they are a staple of my breakfast and midday snack routine.<br />Light, flavorful, and full of vitamins, these only take 20-25 minutes to bake with minimal extras. I am vegan so I use egg substitutes  (3 tbsps flax seed in place of the eggs with 9 Tbs water) and they still bake perfectly."
387835,B004BCT2JI,Scrumptious little suckers but overpriced,"I got them at Wall-Mart for $1.83 a box. With subscribe & save would have cost me $2.38. Now, don't get me wrong, I love S&S, I signed up for a lot of things, but buyer beware, price is not as competitive as we're accostumed with S&S."
35994,B000AEWGBM,Strong Mint Tea,"The tea is fine. I didn't find it that tasty ... I find I prefer Mint Medly or PLantation Mint. I guess I also prefer individually wrapped bags to preserve freshness. But nothing wrong with product; just a matter of my taste, I think"
17578,B0000GH6UQ,Not Good,I found this product disappointing. It did not dissolve quickly and left a gritty residue. It is very high in sugar - almost 70 grams per tab and has saturated fat listed as one of the ingredients.
6471,B000FNEX50,I threw them away,I was disappointed in the unpleasant flavor and dry texture of Nana's Chocolate Munch Cookie Bars. To me there was an odd artificial almost chemical like after taste in them that cocoa powder can't even cover up. I threw away the entire box after tasting the first bar.
2510,B000EH2AMA,good snack for everyone,"it has good tast and crunchy. I bought black sesame before, it is good too. highly recommanded."
9054,B006N3IG4K,Second favorite,"This is my second favorite after the breakfast in bed flavor. I love Wolfgang Puck coffee. It's a little bolder then the breakfast in bed, but still smooth."
15530,B000255OIG,My Dog's Favorite Treat!,He loves the Liver treats and the Lamb treats. They're not much to look at (simple cubes) but he starts to lick his lips whenever he hears me get the can!
3802,B001L1DYAA,Gevalia is the best,Gevalia Kaffee is by FAR the best coffee on the market.<br />Especially the Coastarican peaberry and the Peruvian organic.
76831,B00017WSGQ,Unhappy with this product,I was very disappointed with the quality of these Juniper Berries. They dry and hard and had no aroma or taste.
1682,B001RVFDOO,Popchips  variety box,"I LOVE Popchips!!  These are the BEST.  Individual serving bags, flavors are great, taste is excellent.  My daughter and grandson love the barbeque.  I have found that buying them through Amazon is cheaper and Amazon offers the bigger bags also.  I have to watch that because I could eat the whole bag."
4015,B000UZVPKO,Amazon sardines good for low sodium dieters,"I like this product much better than the canned sardines I am able to find at my local grocery stores.  I buy Rolland and Seasons ( both sold by Amazon ) and in my opinion they are superior in both taste and texture.  It is a toss up for me as to skinned and boneless opposed to the skin on with bones - I like both - there are probally more nutrients in the ones with bones, which, along with the omega 3s is the plus factor for sardines.  They work for me.  I have eaten them since I  was a kid - I'll turn 80 in July. Incidentally, my cat is crazy about them too."
36378,B003ZFNCC0,Something seriously wrong,"The taste is unpleasant (to me), and I found foreign objects mixed in. As far as I am concerned, this is a disgrace to the kosher food industry."
30468,B0026PENE6,Bad,"This is the worst chocolate I have ever had. It tastes like anything but chocolate, just a very weird unpleasant taste. I had a piece and threw it in the trash. It only cost a dollar and it was a dollar too much."
32396,B001AJ1ULS,Drat!,I wish I had read that these are made in China before I bought them.  They are going in the trash - lesson learned.
8224,B000BXUVYG,These are Fabulous!,"I was reminded of my mother's cat when I read the comments about vomiting. Mom's cat gulps the Whiskas Temptations WHOLE and resembles a Kirby vaccuum! If you inhaled your food, you would vomit too! With my kitties, it is an entirely different story - they love them, they chew them, they purr. These are not a dietary supplement, they are a TREAT. I even managed to train my eldest kitty to ""shake hands"" using Temptations. I will definately buy them, again and again."
8810,B003QRGDV4,Great grain free food,"If you're looking for a great grain free alternative to beef or chicken, this is it. My two girls loved it. We used to put some in their Kongs, then put in dry food and then seal the end with more wet food and put it in the freezer so that dinner would become more of a challenge. The only con with this food is that it can be pricey, as are most Wellness products. You could probably get the same results you're looking for from a grain free food with something like Taste of the Wild, which is what we've gone to because of cost."
461351,B000CORSCW,...,It pisses me off seeing pirates booty coming up as a VEGAN item when its obviously not.<br />The seller needs to learn to label/tag their products correctly.
229429,B004CHB3LM,Count your mini Abba Zabas,I ordered 250 mini Abba Zabas and I received my order when it was expected.<br /><br />BUT when I opened the package and counted the mini abba zabas(I was splitting the order with a friend) I discovered I was short 31 mini abba zabas. As of this posting I am waiting for the 31 mini Abba Zabas or a refund.<br /><br />So beware!
4571,B002TMV3E4,So-So - average for decaf,"The aroma of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV3E4"">Melitta Cafe Collection Riviera Sunset Decaffeinated Ground Coffee, 10-Ounce Bags)</a> was fairly weak. Scent, after all, is a huge part of taste, and this was disappointing.<br /><br />Even though I added more coffee grinds than the directions instructed, I found the coffee to be a bit bland. The taste was more than flavored water, but not amazingly so, with no subtle overtones. It wasn't bitter, but it wasn't much of anything.<br /><br />While I generally drink hi-test as opposed to decaffeinated, I do drink decaf at least twice a week. The <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV3E4"">Melitta</a> was comparable to the generic brand that I usually have.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV3E4"">Melitta Cafe Collection riviera Sunset Decaf</a> isn't a bad coffee, but it's not worth the money if there are other options available."
169450,B0049YMBKA,Good Product,I usually don't rave about a product but this Spelt flour is the best I had! You wont be disappointed. We make chapati's (roti) out of  it and tastes great.<br /><br />Will be ordering again.
340948,B000UJTZ8O,Did not work,We tried over and over to catch the moles and no luck. So I would not recommend this product for getting the moles out of your yard.
304351,B001AS1A4Q,5-hour energy,I just had twins in December.  How do I make it through the workday?????  5-hour energy.  Enough said.
72279,B0025VROPG,Portable Pete for Pizza and More!,"Texas Pete is similar to Tobasco sauce, but with less of the distilled flavor and smell of Tobasco Sauce. I would say that it's heat is comparable, but the flavor is what I love. A dribble on a slice of pizza makes a BIG difference and with the small portable packets, I will always have some on hand when I want to add a little zing to my food."
5265,B0012YEKCW,Ignored it,"My two cats must not be interested in grass, because it grew but they ignored it. Had no problems growing it."
1314,B003MCEV0I,One of the best sweet hot sauces out there,"It's not a traditional BBQ sauce in terms of flavor, but you could easily use it for that. It's very thick and has a strong hotness (not too hot - but hotter than most spicy BBQ sauce) and it's made from much better ingredients than most BBQ or sweet hot sauces. It tastes very fruity rather than sugary sweet. It would be great on almost anything grilled or stir fried, and it's incredible in pork and beans. Don't let the price scare you away from this outstanding condiment."
5208,B000G1X456,Finest Around In My Opinion,"My husband and I are always searching for better coffee...and seemingly there seems to be something wrong with them all! LOL I have finally decided that Yuban is without fail MY favorite coffee...it has no aftertaste, is not bitter in any way and it remains constant can after can. On that note, my husband can go grabbing different can after and grinding himself silly if he wishes;  complaining about each one...I'm settled on Yuban forevaaaaaaa. : )"
5857,B001EQ5EJQ,Good choice!,The walnut oil is really good. I later will often come to buy it.I hope you will like it too.
4768,B00139TT72,Not organinc so dont be fooled by the ORGANICS in the name,The number one ingredient is chicken... not organic chicken just the hormone pumped junk you wouldn't eat yourself. I will stick to Natural Balance which is sold here on Amazon as well.
97449,B001ONRO3S,What can you say?  They're Cheez-Its,"The title says it all.  Why would Amazon suggest I write a review.  If you like Cheez-Its you will like these.  They're Cheez-Its.  If, however, you do not like Cheez-Its, don't buy this product because they're Cheez-Its."
524547,B000HBIHPM,LIPTON MANGO INSTANT TEA,"My family loves this tea! Everyone who has ever tried it at my house always asks for it when they visit. I can't buy it locally anymore, so I have to order it through Amazon, and I hope they never stop selling it!"
31845,B0062A87HA,damaged goods!,I ordered 3 packs of 12 cans.  So far I have received 24 cans.  Of those 24 cans 12 were damaged.  I probably will not order again due to the damamge.
394666,B001B4VOQI,dog lover,Our Airedale loves the taste of the Beef Freeze Dried Dog Treats which we use for training. It really works
147565,B001D0IZBM,Shorted amount,"I received two boxes of the Emeril's coffee and counted out the quantity in each box. Instead of 50 as advertised, there were only 49 in each box. Maybe a coincidence, but I will not be ordering them again."
14237,B0045XE32E,"Keeping it simple, this is an excellent quality product for doggies","I will keep this short and sweet.  I have 2 dogs.  One (a fox terrier) can eat anything and suffer no ill effects, at least none I have noticed.  The other (a greyhound) will do poorly if given crap treats like Pupperoni or Beggin' Strips.  This Newman's Lamb and Barley treats was very welcome in my house.  The ingredients are organic, and Barley is one of the easiest to digest grains for dogs. So much better than corn fillers and chemicals they add to food.  When you feed your dog food that is colored yellow, red, or green, you are feeding them useless and unhealthy junk.  That doesn't happen with these treats.<br /><br />The biscuits were about the size of a domino, but thicker. Yep, they were a bit hard to break in half, but when my dogs can crush tennis balls in their mouths, these treats are nothing for them to chew and enjoy.<br /><br />Bottom line was that it did not give my greyhound diarrhea or gas, so that is a big 5 star in my book.  Plus, I like the fact that it isn't junk goodies, but has quality ingredients.  Thanks Newman!"
69898,B001QOQIKK,BUYER BEWARE,"I ordered three of these as gifts, I decided to try some out of one container, the chocolates were dried out, with powdery white on the outside, so hard and disgusting inside, I actually spit them out.  They shouldn't be sold."
454778,B003194PBC,Cat Treats,We have two barn cats that we can't touch. But each evening they visit our back porch to receive their cat treats.
12727,B001ELLB4S,Nasty taste!,"Expensive, nasty and low in protein! I really don't understand how this product has got good reviews. I am not exagerating but the taste is nasty. I drunk it once and the rest I flushed through the toilet. Bad!"
4148,B001EW5YQS,No good for Wii,"Bought it thinking this would plug into the Wii and I would be able to use my condenser microphone with it. Well, long story short, doesnt work. But it is still usable with a PC/laptop to record audio. But we can do that with a builtin mic also. Would u like to pay 1$ towards the presidential election?"
379307,B001TM70XS,My buddies love this stuff,This stuff is the only grain-free canned cat food that all four of my furry buddies agree on!
27586,B000FK52B2,Umm why wont the water stay in!,I read all the reviews before purchasing. Just received the mini sprouter tried to start using but the water keeps leaking out the sides.  Not sure what i could be doing wrong since its only 7 pieces that stack.  Very disappointing!  Returning this ASAP!!
320542,B0015Y943Y,dog treats,"My vet recommends these threats, so it is cheaper to order in quantity.  I received them promptly and will order again when needed"
34213,B001P3NU30,"These are worth an ""8 ears up"" rating, almost.","All four of my dogs, ranging in size from 30 lbs to 85 lbs absolutely love these.  As soon as they hear the crinkly sound of the package they come, sit, and intently watch me with all their ears up and alert (the 8 ears up rating) until they get their chews and then go off to enjoy them.  From the dog's point of view, they're perfect.<br /><br />From my ponit of view, and the reason for deducting a star, is the price for the benefit.  These cost more than ordinary chews and I'm not sure they are any healthier for their teeth and gums than the plain rawhide chews.  One of my dogs is prone to gum disease and often has bad breath, if these worked as advertised, her gums would be healthier and bad breath should be eliminated by the enzyme action.  I've tried giving the dogs nothing but this brand of chews for over a month and there was no detectable improvement.  I'll still be using one bag per month of these in hopes that there really is a benefit, but the bulk of their chew treats will be <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZF06JI"">Green Cow Rawhide Dog Bones, Natural Chips, 5-Pound Bag</a> because of the cost savings."
285074,B001E5E3JY,best sweetener,"I used splenda for years,  a friend told me to go to amazon and get stevia.Best choice ever lost ten pounds and saved alot of money."
52529,B003ANFMY8,Can't live without this cat food,Have been using this cat food now for a few years after the vet recommended dental cleaning (very expensive & put them under anesthesia - no way!).  Our cat is healthy and her teeth seem to be in good condition.  She loves the taste and size.  She won't eat any small food anymore (I have tried some samples) and actually eats all the Science Diet and leaves the small ones for me to discard.  It's a bit pricey but I would recommend it.
46142,B000LR2OVA,HORRIBLE doesn't begin to describe this product!  Very disappointed!,"The product description says: ""Keta Salmon Caviar is from the select roe of the Keta Salmon, which has very large eggs with a color that can range from bright red to brilliant orange.""<br /><br />The caviar I received consisted of really small eggs (about half the size of those at a sushi restaurant) that are mushy, and taste awful. Also, the caviar comes in a can like that of tuna fish or sardines. (Wish I would've known that before placing the order).<br /><br />The worst part of all is the mushy, bad-tasting mess that's inside...probably the result of its ingredients: salmon roe, salt, vegetable oil, sorbic acid.<br /><br />I am NOT happy with my order and feel I just threw money in the garbage.  The *reality* of the product bears *no resemblance* to the photo posted on Amazon.<br /><br />I have three cans of this stuff and don't know what to do with them. I had a ""taste test"" with my cat and dog, who *love* caviar) and they both turned their noses up at it. NOT a good sign.  :-("
210435,B000G7VYWA,what a bargain for stale pretzels,received on 9/22/10 only to find all 12 bags with sell date of august 22 2010.  will get refund but beware.<br />even cartons have stamped 'GOODS MUST BE ROTATED' which i know means put out the oldest first.<br />well they rotated it to me!  I wonder if thats anything like getting the shaft?
71534,B003M1PKUO,Melted mess,These were supposed to be individual chocolate covered blueberries.  What I received was a solid block of chocolate blueberries.  The chocolate had melted and reformed into a solid mess.  Inedible.  Very disappointing.  I have ordered chocolate products from other vendors with no melting issues.
52004,B002CIL78C,BEST EVER FOR POPCORN,This is the cheesiest popcorn cheese ever!  It's not salty like all of the other toppings for popcorn.  You can get your popcorn as cheesy as you want with this topping without oversalting.<br />I also had trouble finding this cheese in the stores.  I couldn't even find it on the Kraft site itself.  I hope they are not going to discontinue this product because there isn't anything even close to it on the market.
303963,B0029NVJ4M,Love these!,"My cat loves these treats. Whenever she sees the bag, or hears it crinkles, she starts to meow. She has a hairball problem, and these treats help with that."
103826,B000ZHEO1O,is there fish?,I have a fish (swimming type) allergy and this gave me the same reaction when i eat fish.....If you have a fish allergy beware!!!!
524987,B003Z3W232,"Gran sabor, poca cantidad","Tiene el aut&eacute;ntico sabor de Bronte Pistachio cream, pero menos de la mitad de su contenido.- &iquest;Puede ser debido al transporte?"
74663,B0026RQTGE,Great for picky eaters,My dog is the pickiest eater and does not enjoy many treats but he goes crazy over this one. It helps freshen his breath but I don't know how to evaluate the cleaning ability of this product. The only bad thing is that it will make your dog fat if he eats too much.
280586,B001EQ5QW6,Total Raisin Bran,"I never thought getting items in the 6-pack would be a savings, but it was.  Subscribe & Save is actually cheaper than buying this in the store!"
27292,B002ZJQ3L4,Not what I thought,"Okay, so call me stupid, but I was searching for small packs of jerky for lunch snacks and saw this one advertised as 36 count.  I actually thought I was going to get 36 individual oz or less packages of beef jerky.  Imagine my surprise when I got one 15oz package (not even a pound) for $36 plus shipping.  I hope the taste and texture is worth it!"
9186,B006N3IG4K,Love this creamy coffee,"This is my favorite KCup.  I'd describe it as medium-dark, creamy and rich.  And very consistent.  A lot of k-cups seem acidic to me, so i'm really glad i found this one. :]"
320823,B0030F3LCQ,Works well for my needs,I use this tuna to supplement my cats diet.  They like it.  Occasionally I will eat some and I also like it.
7124,B004K30HO2,Good product,"These cups are usable as stated.  They are exactly what I was looking for which was a less expensive method to have coffee.  They do leak slightly but not too bad. Not sure if it makes the hole's a little larger than the prepackaged cups.  But on the high side, I do get the have the coffee that I want, the way I want it. Which is great."
5602,B000G1X45G,Delicious!,"They have this coffee at where I work... and before this, they had this horrible folgers coffee which HAD to be diluted with sweetner and creamer... I can actually drink this black because it's actually good! It tastes like a coffee that was brewed from a cafe, not just your coffee machine at home. Good stuff."
7239,B001HTE5HM,My new favorite snack!!,"I have been snacking on the crackers from this line, for a long time now, and someone suggested that I try these Sticks & Twigs. I love everything about them! I love the crunch and the texture of them, and, of course, I love the taste of them, especially with the curry flavor! They are not only delicious, but they are also very nutricious, with lots of protein and fiber in them. They make the PERFECT snack!"
513,B000G6RYNE,Vinegar... Not my taste!,This is the first time I tried Sea Salt & Vinegar chips. Not my taste.  Make sure you like salt & vinegar before ordering. You may be in for a suprise if you have never tried them before.  I'll stick with the salt and black pepper chips.
8530,B003VXFK44,Either I got a bad batch or....,"...or the good reviewers' taste buds are weak.  This is some disappointingly<br />weak coffee.  I'm not some crazy ""gotta have my jet black sludge to get<br />through the day"" coffee drinker - I'd say my favorite (and my wife's) is<br />Caribou Blend.  This blend is WEAK, it can't hold half-and-half or even<br />just whole milk without being wiped out.  Now, I will say I brew it on<br />the ""large cup"" (9.25 oz, I believe) setting on our Keurig, so maybe it's<br />a bit better on the 8oz setting, or even the small setting.  But Caribou (we<br />also like Donut Shop, Green Mountain Kona Blend 10%, etc.) can be easily<br />brewed on 9.25 and hold a good bold taste.  This coffee doesn't<br />hold a CANDLE to any of those.  Now I'm stuck with 40+ of these. Blech...maybe<br />the guests won't mind it! :)"
618,B000G6RYNE,awesome chips,these are the best chips out there.. nothing can beat this taste. if you like honey mustard then you will definitely like this.. once you eat it you wont stop..addicting stuff
9328,B006N3IG4K,coffee pod,trying out different pods and this is a delicious one. service was excellent. no hassle at all. will buy from again
2568,B000ED9LDU,a little expensive,It was my mistake - I thought there were 6 bags rather than 4. So the price per bag is much higher than what I pay at the local grocery for the same product.
6516,B005O8BLLU,Great first food,"My baby loves this. It's a great first food to start with when teaching your baby to have solids. The pouch makes it easy to get the product out, without making a mess and the lid is easy to refasten, so you can use it again over a few feeds."
161221,B008O3G2K2,They are a hit!,"My two Min Pins, who are constantly begging for treats, and then turning their noses up as most of what is offered to them, absolutely love this product.  They actually sat in front of me and took turns licking from the container.  It was hysterical; like two hamsters drinking water.  I will but this product again!"
70385,B001IZIBIY,very disappointed,I did not enjoy this product and Ifelt it was old and not up to what I had hoped for and I would have returned it but it was not possible.
67881,B000G6MBUA,Favorite Kettle flavor and a great value!,"After reading some of the reviews, I got nervous and opened a bag from my recent order expecting the worst! No worries here. All bags are in great shape and expiration dates aren't until June. Chips, at least from the first bag, taste like they are supposed to and all is good in the world! By the way, fifteen bags for under thirty dollars is a ton less expensive than the going price around here at the local grocery store so, yay team!"
4519,B002TMV3E4,Good-quality coffee at a decent price,"I'm a big coffee drinker (much against my better judgement), but due to a stomach condition, I've been ""forced"" to drink mostly decaf for the last few years. I usually just get the cheapest coffee I can find near my office; after all, I don't make a lot of money and every penny counts. So it was nice to get this Melitta Cafe ground coffee to sample.<br /><br />When I made my first cup, I was immediately attacted by the pleasant aroma. I put in a little cream and 4 Splendas as I usually do, and found the taste a little on the light side yet quite bitter. Maybe it's because this is decaf, but what I did like was its pureness, something 50-cent coffees usually lack. I have made two cups a day since my first taste and over the last couple of days I've grown to like this coffee. Granted, to me coffee is pretty much like wine in that all the different varieties taste more or less the same except for the level of bitterness, but even I can tell this is gourmet coffee, much better than the ones I get at my local coffee stands or even at McDonald's (when they give out free cups).<br /><br />For a pack of 3, the price seems decent. If you drink decaf, I think this is quite worth a try."
8100,B002L2RIQO,Very weak tea,"As a fan of English & Irish breakfast teas, I found this tea to be very weak flavored.  If you like milder/weaker teas, this may be for you.  But if you like more robust flavors, steer clear of this one."
80840,B003DMXDGA,...,It pisses me off seeing pirates booty coming up as a VEGAN item when its obviously not.<br />The seller needs to learn to label/tag their products correctly.
2002,B001E5E29A,Great tasting pancake  mix,This is the best tasting pancake mix in the market and it is so easy to make.
393497,B0002ASM94,Good chew bone for small dogs,My 8 pound Rat Terrier Loves these. They are made of had plastic so they will last for quite a while.
504165,B004IRCHQG,Waiting two months for it to ship....wtf?,"I ordered this on February 18th and have yet to receive despite 'in stock' status. I dont see any link to contact with regard to the order, so I thought I'd write a review. Perhpaps I'll see them by summer!"
7291,B004I5KO9K,Tasty buy slimy,"The flavors are really good but the crackers get a bit slimy as you chew them. If that doesn't bother you, then they're a great low-carb snack."
8340,B003VXFK44,poorly sealed,"The coffee is good. However, at least half of these haven't been sealed correctly. When I brew them the edge of the foil pops open and coffee grounds go everywhere. Not fun to clean. It may have just been the batch we got, but I won't be ordering these again."
8886,B001EQ5EQE,Smooth to the last drop,"This espresso is delicious.  It's strong, but not too strong, and full-bodied and it's terrific for making cappuccino.  This brand is probably my favorite."
100041,B000LQORDE,wonderfull goodness in your mouth,"Dont hesitate, get these and put them in your mouth. well cook them then get those noodles in your mouth."
43238,B001F32S0Q,rip off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"you can get this for less then $5.00, please people shop around i have this same item and it did not cost $50.00"
4016,B000UZVPKO,An excellent item for an excellent price,"Sardines are rising in popularity as people discover more about their health benefits... and that they aren't so stinky after all (especially less so after cooking!).<br /><br />I've used numerous varieties of the Roland sardines: olive oil, s&b in olive oil, tomato sauce, etc.  The S&B version with low sodium and packed in water is my best recommendation/preference: a great value for the money, and practically a steal when you compare -per ounce- the price with other brands.  Then, consider the discount(s) when purchasing through Amazon, and it'll be tough to choose another.  Why?  Many other brands charge the same price as -or more than Roland- with only a 3.5-oz tin, whereas Roland includes more fish in the tin.  The quality is consistent, and the sardines themselves are quite succulent and versatile enough to be included in stir-fries, salads, pasta dishes, etc. without overpowering the other flavors.<br /><br />Oddly enough, I was half-mindful when perusing a semi-local dollar store which is renowned for carrying a ton of food items in my city.  I was looking to make some lower-cost and healthier choices in my diet at the time (not expecting to find these, of course, but rather turning my nose up at the usual crud I saw stocked there) when I accidentally stumbled across them.  At $1 per tin, it was a huge buy, so I tried a few.  The rest, as they say, is history as aforementioned."
1443,B001E50UEQ,I'm a fan,I subscribe to several Hormel Compleats. This is definitely the best flavored dinner I have tried.  I am planning to double my subscription.
50628,B000FPM22E,Geber Barley Cereal,the only reason I purchased this on amazon is because I could not find it in the stores and the pediatrician had recommended it for my infant grandson.  It does not disolve well and tends to clump up in the nipple.
1636,B001RVFDOO,A yummy alternative to high-fat chips!,"I'm a crunchaholic! I have to have something during the day to crunch! All other chips are so high in fat or sodium that it makes it very difficult to be eating healthy and still get my crunch on. PopChips is the answer and the individual bags are a great way to control your calories too! I highly recommend them all, but the salt and pepper are my least favorite!"
86357,B0043C6FC8,Mickey Mouse Shortbread,"The package was wrapped properly. The cookies were not fresh. They were broken into small pieces. Considering shipping charge, overall the price wasn't worth for these cookies. I wish I had purchased more at the Disneyland."
4648,B0009P68JI,awesome!!,"I love to eat pasta but totally clueless on how to make one...saw this while at the grocery earlier, decided to try it, followed the instructions and viola... one awesome dinner!! note: I did add some parmesan and romano cheese to add more flavor.."
84064,B004I1H122,I love this tea but...,"... I wished they didn't raise its price recently..<br />Now, it's cheaper to buy it at the store (around $7.69)."
456708,B0009ETA6W,Essential for breast feeding moms with supply issues,As an extended breast feeding mom I found my milk supply was gradually waning.  This product helped boost my supply within a couple days.  I did find it easier to take after I had eaten though and with LOTS of water.
279441,B0001IOSDQ,cvl8on,Marinate 1 - 3 days.  Then BBQ at a very low heat.<br />Nearest thing we have found to BBQ Pork that you get in a Chinese Resturant.

387109,B002AJ1RME,"Yep, love these things","Go to bar for workouts.  Like the taste and they seem to satisfy energy requirements while being low glycemic.  Don't know what the score is, but ingredients seem very similar to the 4Real bars."
13374,B001BSBFUO,Dogs love them!,Both of my dogs take medication on a daily basis and without these pill pockets it would be the biggest hassle ever!!!
242798,B000BF3AII,yuk,"i guess that i was expecting something ""chunkier""<br />it tastes like salty mush to me - i started adding it to big pots of chili to try to use it up"
7867,B000LKUU7W,Top 10 Super Food,"Wow, organic lentils, how great is that! Lentils are one of the planet's top 10 super foods, extremely high in protein and fiber, extremely low on the glycemic index and inflammation scale. This is one food I try to eat everyday. I live in a pretty unsophisticated town in the central valley of California, and you'd think our ""high-end"" supermarket, Raley's, would carry organic lentils, but of course, they don't, and even if they did, I'd have to pay an arm and leg for them. Amazon is my lifeline for quality organic foods and other products. Incidentally, I don't make the typical lentil soup with these. I simply cook one bag (16 oz.) with about 7.5 cups of non-fluoridated bottled water (fluoride is extremely bad for your thyroid), salt them to taste, and only cook them for 25 minutes. This way, they don't get mushy. They keep their firmness without being too chewy, more like a bean, and then I keep them in the fridge for a week, and have them with a little organic shredded cheese on top. YUMMY!"
6104,B001LNZG9U,sour,"I tried this carrot juice for the first time today and regret buying it.  I took my first sip and actually wondered if someone had put pickle juice in the jar.  It was awful.  I've had several carrot juices and never had any as sour as this.  It is difficult to fathom how this product is still produced.  It has lemon juice in it, but apparently far far too much.  If you enjoy pickle juice with your carrot juice, you will love this product.  I don't."
4101,B001EW5YQS,Great value way to use my nice Rode mic,"I have some nice mics round my place for video and thought I could use them to help my skype chats, and for the money it is amazing little USB device."
66003,B0007A0AQW,"Zuke's Mini Naturals Dog Treats Roasted Chicken Recipe, 16-Ounce","Zuke's Mini Naturals Dog Treats Roasted Chicken Recipe, 16-Ounce, this product was turned down by my pet.  Gave it to another who had three dogs and only one of the dogs would eat it and the other two would not even take it out of the hand of owner.  I tried this product because it was a american product, would not recommend."
7748,B001E5DZTS,toddler - milk substitute,"My 15 month old has been on this for 3 months and loves it.<br />It is easy to make,(you do have to shake it a bit when you make it).<br />we add probiotics to it, for a little extra immune boosting and it<br />works great as a substitute for milk.<br />our naturalpathic doc tells us this is easier on the toddlers digestive<br />system and may even aid in less ear infections.<br />so far so good!<br />amazon has the best deal we could find also!"
527,B000G6RYNE,Best Salt & Vinegar!,I have tried a lot of S&V chips and these are the best!  Real sea salt and REAL vinegar!  Mouth-watering flavor & crispiness.  Not for the faint of heart - the flavor is very authentic!  :)
30671,B000RWJMJQ,I wouldn't buy this again,Two of the six packages had lost their vacuum seal so were completely tasteless.  The still-sealed ones were not nearly as tasty as Yuban.  I would NOT buy this product again.
1716,B001RVFDOO,love this snack,Everyone should try these chips. They are healthier than regular chips. And they taste good.
22316,B003BGK6Q8,Great training treat,"My puppy is a very picky eater, which makes it hard to find training treats that she'll work for.  But she loves these!"
55185,B000EFBMA8,A staple at our house,"My kids BEG for Cheesy Enchilada. I used to be able to find it at a local store, but now I can't find it locally at all!  Thank you amazon!<br /><br />I make it per package directions, and add a can of rinsed black beans to the simmer time.<br />I serve it with flour tortillas, sourcream, shredded cheese, salsa and sometimes sliced avocados.<br /><br />It's always a hit at our house.  We make it 1-2 times a month!"
340325,B000H2DZS0,favorite,hello panda is very addicting.  try eating just a few.  it is not possible!
3780,B00016UX0K,Great Sauce!,Tried this sauce first at our favorite place to eat out.  Was very happy to be able to order some for our home cooking!  Great!  Spicy Hot and Sweet!
65598,B001EQ55ZO,Like a mouthful of pepper,"The product description currently states that these nuts have ""a hint of pepper.""  Don't you believe it.  There's at least as much pepper on these as there is salt, and there's too much of both.  I can't taste anything but the pepper when I eat them, and they're so salty that I'm thirsty afterwards.  This is a terrible product, and the company needs to seriously scale back their seasonings."
6559,B003AYL9NU,My dog loves them!,My four year old chinese crested mix loves these dog treats. He is somewhat of a picky eater when it comes to dog treats but he loves these. They smell nice and minty and take a little while for him to eat so it gives him something to work at. They are made with good ingredients. No meat byproducts or corn! AND they are made in the USA which is definite plus. I will continue to get these for my pup.
43565,B001EQ4P2I,Wasabi+Soy=AWESOME,"The title says it all.<br /><br />The wasabi+soy flavors combine to a deliciousness that is out of this world.  If you haven't tried them yet, you're missing out."
152003,B00141R0IO,Healthy and good for your dog,My dog loves the taste of these treats.  They have glucosamine in them which is why i tried them.  He can't get enough of them.
9327,B006N3IG4K,Great Taste!,"I love this coffee!  I am not a strong coffee drinker and this coffee is perfect!  I have no problems with it working in my Cuisinart Keurig Brewer, I aways get the perfect tasting cup of coffee.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because one of the 2 packs contained only 13 K-Cups and not the 24 that it was supposed to have.<br /><br />The decaf 24-count (pack of 2) arrived with the correct amount of K-cups and is as yummy as the high test!"
1910,B005FG6KZ8,Delicious,"These are quite tasty and delicious, I love them....BUT the prices here are RIDICULOUS!!! Did I say Ridiculous? Oh So RIDICULOUS!!! But Im here to rate the product not the price...5 Stars for the Product."
57306,B00817GPWQ,"Weakest, worst 'French Vanilla' coffee i've ever tasted!","As a longtime avid fan of vanilla flavored coffee, I was excited about trying this brand of 'French Vanilla' on our new Keurig machine. In short, I am VERY dissapointed with this one! At any setting on the Keurig, this coffee tastes terrible. There is next to no vanilla flavor or notes (and the little there is tastes totally artificial and way off on accuracy for vanilla), and the coffee itself tastes very cheap and low quality. I wouldn't even give away these remaining French Vanilla K-cups, so I just tossed them in the garbage."
451079,B001E5DWZU,Perfect,As a British Citizen this product is as ordered and well within sell by date and I have no problem recommending it
29018,B000A0WLFC,Great for a hot-lover!  (No pun intended),"I got this set for my husband for part of his Christmas present and he loved it.  He didn't know that Dave's Insanity wasn't the hottest he could get until now - he immediately opened the Ultimate and started ""practicing"" eating it on crackers until it wouldn't make him sweat so he could embarrass his brother by making him sick with it when we went home for the holidays.  Next year I'm getting the bloody mary mix as a stocking stuffer, and maybe the nuts too."
281427,B001EO7J3W,SALTY!!!,"These tomatoes are inconsistently salted.  Some are so salty, and others are moderately salty.  You never know what you're going to get.  I don't care for them."

1482,B00132EDUW,Margherita Pizza,"I wanted to make authentic italian margherita pizza at home so I ordered this and Caputo ""00"" flour.  These tomatoes are amazing,  and taste just liek the tomatoes at our favorite Italian pizza restaurant.  The label says there is basil in it but i did not detect visually or in taste any basil.  This stuff is jsut awesome.  I ordered another 8 cans.  Shipping kills though."
8571,B003VXFK44,Rich and wonderful,"Creme Caramel is by far my newest favorite!  Great coffee flavor, not too weak, with a wonderful caramel aroma!"
20466,B001BDDTB2,My cats vote  yes!,"If my two cats were to write this review, they's give Petite Cuisine Chicken Pot Pie and Chinese Chicken eight paws up.  They like it; I assume that they like the flavor and consistency.  And the liquid isn't 'water,' it's broth and the first part that my guys eat.  I like that it's 'kitty healthy,' but the cost is a bit steep."
22208,B000KV61FC,Dog gets distracted by the treats,"My dog loves tug-a-war with ropes and etc so I thought this would be a great toy for her, since she is left alone during the day while I'm at work.  The problem is that she tugs on the rope, then smells the treats inside, then won't mess with the rope at all and instead spends her time sniffing at the ""scent holes"" and from the neck of the bottle.  She will try to stick her tongue into the neck of the bottle.  I've demonstrated to her over and over that pulling on the rope dispenses a treat, but she just refuses to pull on the rope, even when I hold onto the bottle end and try to get her to play tug-a-war.  She smells the treat and doesn't want to play, she wants the treat, and she doesn't understand it.  I even took AKC liver treats and cut them into 1/4 and liberally filled the bottom of the jar with them, so that even a mild tug on the rope would result in a piece of treat being released.  She just has no interest in pulling on the rope at all.  She will mess with it for a few minutes and when she can't get the treats out, she leaves it alone.  I was pretty disappointed with it.  I think it would help if they made the outside knot smaller so you could pass the rope through the back of the bottle.  That way you I could get my dog to just play with the rope without worrying about the treats and try putting it back in the bottle once she got used to it.  As is, I've had it a month and she doesn't get, so I'm considering cutting the knot off the end so she can at least play with the bottle and dump the treats out, and play with whats left of the rope seperately."
45237,B000JKCZXG,"Boring, Dry and Bland","I made this cupcakes after biting the bullet because they are way too expensive for a mix, but I hoped for the best. They were rather dry and donuty and the frosting had an off unpleasant taste. I'm not sure but the vanilla in the frosting tasted artificial. I would not reccommend this mix because of the high price and rather low quality."
742,B001HTKZ5S,"Do Not Buy This ""Frosting""","I can honestly say this is the worst frosting we have ever bought. It's kind of generous to call it frosting, it has more the consistency of rubber cement. And since we were in a time crunch, we didn't have the luxury of going back out to the store for a different frosting, so we forged ahead and decorated a cake with it. Horrible experience, bad enough to put us off cake decorating forever. It spread about as easily as chewing gum, stuck to everything it came in contact with, and got crumbs of the cake mixed up in it. On top of all this, it didn't even taste good. By the time we were done decorating, we knew there was no way we could feed this mess to our family. So we ended up going to the store anyway to buy a pre-made cake. Our cake, which took twice as long to decorate because this stuff is so gooey, was used as a centerpiece. A really ugly centerpiece, that cracked and peeled as the frosting dried."
44241,B001E5DRHI,not tannic not exciting.,"finally bought some of this and i am not impressed. its weak and doesnt live up to thedescription on dilmah's website.<br />my favorite is their ceylon supreme, i like the Meda watte, but thats it. i am done with their specialty teas"

4539,B002TMV3E4,"Smooth, Rich Coffee","Melitta Cafe is a smooth, flavorful coffee that compares well with regular coffee.  This is not the typical weak decaf blend that is true of many American brands.  Melitta has a rich, deep taste and a nice dark color.  Tastes great black or with cream.  As a stand alone coffee (no cream/sugar) it has a smooth, though strong flavor just like regular coffee.  This coffee is especially great as an after dinner drink.  Strong enough to taste like regular coffee but decaffeinated so it will not prevent sleep later.  Great coffee."
21842,B000KV61FC,Great Toy for a dog that's tough on toys,"Our dog loves her Bad CUZ, but this toy she loves more than any other.  She's a VERY tough chewer, and it's survived for quite some time with no damage.  One thing - protect your toes with this toy - it's pretty heavy and does get swung around a bit.  I wouldn't recommend this toy if you have low tables with knick-knacks, sensitive shins or teeny kids that may get bonked with it.  Ours has gotten thrown (by the dog) repeatedly down the stairs onto a hard floor and hasn't broken yet.<br />As far as treats to go into it - remember that the rope is knotted inside the jug, so don't put anything into the jug that's soft or the rope will end up smelling REALLY nasty..."
22900,B004ZIER34,"Low acid coffee, but needs to improve flavor","My wife has occasional heartburn with drinking more then one cup of coffee, particularly with bolder blends. I got this for her since she likes dark roasts, but doesn't like the problems associated with them. After two cups, she found that the coffee wasn't bitter and was very smooth for a dark roast. No heartburn at all. The overall flavor wasn't bad, but it wasn't something that she would be drawn to in the future. Might try other flavors though."

I wanted Henry's blend .<br />I was and am so upset that I paid all that money for 5 bags of what I thought was Henry's blend .<br />I would never buy coffee without first tasting it. I knew what Henry's blend tasted like.<br />I would have bought one bag of their new coffee and tried it out.<br />Henry's blend was so luscious and rich. I'm lost until I find another coffee brand.<br />I've been buying Henry's blend for years. I miss it and I want it back!!!!!!!!!<br />I want to send it back .

1584,B001CWZXIY,Excellent for Wheaten Terrier's Sensitive Tummies!,"Harmony Farms produces EXCELLENT dog food products!  Our 8 month soft-coated wheaten terrier is sensitive to gluten, corn meal and other products generally found in the popular  brands.  We were preparing to take him to the vet at about 4 months old b/c he had great difficulty eliminating -- to the point of whining as he would attempt to go.  After more research on the breed we purchased Harmony Farms at a local store -- it was expensive but quickly resolved our puppy's digestive issues.  After 5-8 days on only Harmony Farms products our puppy was happy and healthy!<br /><br />I was so happy to find Harmony Farms on Amazon!  It is more economical AND delivered right to our door.  Our puppy, Connor, eats only Harmony Farms dog food and treats and is a much happier puppy now. Definitely recommend it for soft-coated wheaten terriers and other breeds that have difficulty digesting the popular brands."

48734,B001EQ4ADC,Spoiled,"I unpacked the box of Old Wisconsin turkey snack bite sausage pieces and put the separate packages on my pantry shelf and kept one out to open and my mouth was watering.  After the first package was consumed I took another package of them out of the pantry and started in on it.  Wasn't too much later in the following week I noticed a pretty unpleasant smell in the pantry.  I thought for sure a rodent had got trapped somehow and probably died and was slowly rotting somewhere I could not see nor could I find anything of the sort.  The smell lasted and I scratched my head and wondered if the dead thing would eventually just dry up. Pretty soon my whole place smelled like the county landfill on a busy day. Well, it wasn't too long I went to grab another bag of the turkey sausage and gosh I found out the hard way where the small was emanating from all this time.  The bag of sausage I had just picked up was all rotted inside and it was totally putrid.  It was totally disgusting and it made my stomach feel a tad queasy.  I took the bag out and placed it in my garbage can and now I just can't wait till the City of Oswego KS comes and empties that can at the landfill. I have had my fill of this stuff! I doubt I will ever buy sausages from this company again!"

5727,B003TIVBSU,High Qaulity at an Excellent price,"I am a professional chef and specialize mostly in pastry, cakes, and desserts. It plays hell with my diabetes but I just love creating some delicious dessert for friends when we have small gatherings.<br /><br />I usually buy vanilla beans in Tijuana, Mexico because I can get good quality at a decent price. By that I mean the beans tend to be supple, shiny, and aromatic. By ""decent price"" I mean it usually costs me around $1.50 to $2.00 per piece.<br /><br />When I saw this half-pound package at such a low price I was skeptical but I figured the $25 would not be a big risk and if they were bad I can always return them. I ordered on Jan 11 and got them Jan 13. Free two-day shipping being another great feature of my Amazon Prime membership which I now believe is an excellent value.<br /><br />The beans are very high quality. They are ""Gourmet Bourbon"" which means about 30% moisture (a good thing) and they are shiny and nicely oily (you want the oily surface as that is one part where a lot of flavor is located. The other part is in the seeds and that is the reason the bean is split and the seeds scrapped when used).  These beans are very fresh as shown by their flexibility (as beans grow old they dry out and get brittle- still usable but not as good).  They come sealed in a vacuum bag and that is inside a zip bag. Even through the double packaging the scent is very noticeable and complex.<br /><br />This is a large quantity of beans. If you are not going to use them rapidly I recommend separating into two or three bean lots and vacuum packing those. For optimal shelf-life I keep mine in a wine refrigerator (it gets cool but not cold) where I keep my 20 or 30 pounds of various chocolates.<br /><br />This is an excellent deal on good quality. I just can't figure out how they manage to make a buck on this one!"
6820,B001LG945O,I wanted to like it more,"I was really looking forward to sampling this product. It's not bad, but a little too sweet-tasting for me. Also, at 140 calories for an 8.3 oz can, I thought that was on the high end. But it does contain 34 grams of sugar, and one must remember that fruit juice is not low in calories. I would have preferred more sparkling water and less juice. On the plus side, it has no artificial ingredients or colors. And no corn syrup! I am sure many will like this product more than I, especially those who prefer more sweetness in their beverages."
7889,B003V0Q1VI,Great deal,"I switched to sea salt a couple of years ago and have found these McCormick grinders very handy ways of dispensing. My attraction was the price. This deal is better than any I have found in local grocery stores... even with shipping/handling. Well worth the price. Shipment was fast, no breaking or damage.

I contacted Good Earth because I was so upset at the change in their product.  They informed me that they make a version with artificial flavor and one without as well as organic.  The organic does not contain artificial flavor.  Since it seems to be a game of change as to whether you get artificial flavor or not when ordering this product.  If it is important to you that it be all natural, I recommend getting the organic variety."

3571,B0040PWYVO,Good  value for me,"We live in an area that does not have a lot of stores that carry organic at reasonable prices. That said I found the product to be a good value and convenient not to have to sometimes wait for local stores to restock, if they even stocked.<br /><br />Yes, some cans get dented in transit but it really was not a big problem for me. I hope the future delivery is the same or better.<br /><br />It is unknown if the can lining is BPA free. I try to avoid it but until the manufactures get it out it's near impossible to buy canned goods that don't have BPA in the can lining. Pregnant women should avoid anything with BPA in it and if I had growing children I would also strive to avoid."

13316,B004BCV53O,BabyMama,"My baby is ready for some new foods in her diet so I decided to give Gerber 2nd Foods a try. Gerber 2nds is vastly different from the other brands of 2nd baby foods that we have tried. The other brands seem to be similar in consistency. There is really no difference in the consistency of Gerber 1sts and 2nds. The difference is that 2nds includes turkey, chicken and beef and 1sts are all fruits and veggies. My baby did not find Gerber 2nds appetizing. The color and odor of the chicken is also nothing like actual chicken. I placed the lid back on the jar and refrigerated the jar since I was hoping to try it with her for another meal. The next day I got the Gerber 2nds jar from the fridge and reheated it. When it was reheated the food was so runny that she could have drunk it from a bottle. The consistency does not keep from one day to the next. If you're looking for a baby food with chicken, turkey, or beef then I would recommend that you try Beech Nut Stage 1. My baby loved the Beech Nut turkey, chicken, and beef. The only problem is that the major grocery stores in my area do not sell Beech Nut. Next trip that I make I plan to stock up on the Beech Nut!"

Use scissors and save yourself the aggravation."

1615,B001RVFDOO,Can't beat the taste.,A while ago I got a bag of the BBQ at a store to go with my lunch and I loved these so when I was searching amazon and found these on subscribe and save I knew that this was something that I had to have for my lunches. I love the fact you get all the different flavors and as of yet I have not found a flavor I did not like. Being from England I am very picky about my flavors of chips or crisps as I would call them as there seems to be such limited flavors but this box gives me flavors I can't complain. I also love the fact that 5% fat is the fat content which just makes them an even better snack. My only issue now is that I have to fight my husband and son over them because they love them just as much as I do. I have now had to go to a box a month but even then I am not sure I can have enough for the month with the three of us eating them every chance we can.
4963,B001DW2RGO,Has an affect.,"Six Hour Power does help to create a more energetic and alert state.  The affect does not last anywhere near six hours.  For me it was a couple of hours.

(I've found this to be true for several other items on this site.)<br />I'm not sure if this is a misprint .... Amazon doesn't seem to think it's an issue since the seller can charge whatever they want for the item.  I disagree, and think it's Amazon's responisbility to get to the bottom of this."

47236,B0029O10P4,Im skeptical as to what is in these things!,So my cat loves these things. She practically hisses at me at random times and jumps on the counter throws the bag on the floor and starts swatting the bag all over the house. I then put them in the cubbard and I found her in the cubbard one day crying to get out. Its insane. She acts like someone on crack. Im starting to question what they put in these. Is there really a lot of regulation regarding cat snacks. I doubt it. Ive tried to stop giving them to her but she then turns her back to me and pouts for days to weeks on end. It has taken me a while to figure out what was going on with her and I have narrowed it down to these Temptation snacks. Im concerned about what drugs they put in these.

2476,B002JX7GVM,If You REALLY Like Sweet...,"...Then O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is the drink for you.  I found this drink to be almost overpoweringly sweet as a standalone beverage.  According to the package, O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE contains natural coconut water, natural pineapple juice, cane juice, vitamin C, and natural fruit flavor.  Personally, with the coconut and the pineapple, I think they could have left out the sugar cane.<br /><br />However, when I paired O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE with a light snack of cheese and crackers, it became a very tasty, refreshing drink.  I, apparently, needed a little salt and/or savory to make O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE completely palatable.  With the afore mentioned snack, the O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is really delightful.  I can also see it being very invigorating on a hot summer today (not so much with the cold winter weather).<br /><br />O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE comes in a handy 8.5 oz box with a place to punch a straw through.  This type of packaging is nice if you are on the go or have kids.  Just throw it in your bag and go.<br /><br />Prior to this experience, I had not heard of coconut water.  On the packaging it says ""O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is a blend of the natural water from inside a young, green coconut and sweet, golden pineapple juice. It has five essential electrolytes, more potassium than a banana, no fat, no cholesterol, and no preservatives.""  Huh...who knew you could drink a green coconut?  Educational and a good source of potassium.  Being allergic to bananas, it is always good to have another source.<br /><br />Overall, I would not drink O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE by itself in the middle of winter.  But together with non-sugary snack or in the high heat of summer, I would definitely give O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE another try."
48017,B004SRH2B6,Good batch,"Starting off- I hate the taste of coconut water. I like coconuts, coconut milk and things that are flavored with coconut, but the water is aweful! I have been only drinking the chocoloate coconut water (which is mixed w/a little coconut cream), but at 110 calories and sugars added I decided that I need to expand my horizons. I did hesitate b/c I read many of the reviews and some people received bad batches (if I were this person, I would have definately contacted the company)- however my batch was good! And while this doesn't taste like the chocolate coconut water (which tastes like slightly watery chocolate milk), this is pretty decent and I will continue my subscription."

7430,B005LMLXN0,As good as advertised,"I saw an ad for Runa guayusa in Mother Jones magazine and because it is a Fair Trade item and described as less bitter than tea, I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />It is exactly as advertised - no bitterness, just a little hint of sweetness, and a nice gentle flavor.  Very easy drinking, and it does give a kick of caffeine energy.  I have been a Diet Pepsi / Diet Coke drinker for 25 years because I like their tastes and the caffeine (never could do coffee and tea is too bitter), but I have recently converted to being a bicycle commuter for work and needed to ditch the heavy soda drinks.  This guayusa is perfect - as tea bags, it is obviously lighter than hauling around sodas, and it has more caffeine too.  Better for me, too.  And no bitterness like tea or coffee.  And I'm supporting fair trade small farmers in Ecuador instead of giant soda companies.  The packaging is 100% recycled, 70% post-consumer.<br /><br />This guayusa is as good as advertised, I like drinking it, and I can't think of any negatives.  5 stars.  I'm glad I found this product, it is worth the price."

You cannot go wrong with these because they are all natural.<br />The only thing that I would say is a little disappointing about them is that some of the pieces are very small making them no good as treats.  You end up with liver ""dust"" when the larger pieces are used.  I generally take this ""dust"" and mix it into home made dog food for extra flavor.  Therefore, no product gets wasted."

I don't get it.  I was given one can, so I can only rate my one short experience with it as non-effective, and not worth the unpleasant taste.  I won't be going out of my way to buy one.  But, if I wanted a couple energy drinks, and they were the only ones available, I guess I would get them.  But there really is no point."
548482,B000ER6YGI,Great baby food!,My son loves them.  How can you complain when your baby is gobbling up vegetables?
49868,B000FKMNSM,LifeSavers,"Everyone at work loves LifeSavers, whether you crunch or suck on them.  All except the GREEN and WHITES.  Come on LifeSavers, bring out a grape\blackberry only bag!"
473074,B008FHUKE6,Hazelnut k-cups,These are so yum. They're my favourite flavoured coffee!  Wish they sold them in South Africa so that I didn't have to buy online only.
18130,B008ZRKZSM,Outrageious pricing,"The pricing is way off.  The description says that it is a savings over the $14.95 retail price, but that is the price of 4 jars at Bell Plantation's website, not just one like on Amazon.  I will be buying this somewhere else."
168392,B0001ES9F8,Senseo Sumatra Coffee,"This is my very favorite coffee, and I am very sad that it has been unavailable for months.  Unfortunately, my Senseo Supreme coffee machine will not allow use of most brands of pods."
57561,B0029NWW5W,Variety Pak,This was a no brainer.  I bought it on sale so it was less expensive than the grocery store and had free shipping.  My dog loves this brand and it is a no mess no fuss package.
8094,B000QSORLO,Eukanuba,"Puppy loves the food.  Never has digestive issues.  Love the 16 lb bag, so I only have to buy one per month."
6981,B004K30HO2,disposakup,work OK. main problem they leak out the top a bit as well as inside the machine.  is it worth the extra work?  it is if you want to pay a fraction of the cos of a k-cup.  plus you can use any coffee you desire.
2143,B002BB7EWI,Tasty and convenient!,"I discovered these when my daughter was about 15 months old. I wish I had found them earlier. They are organic, taste great, are easy for toddlers to handle and very convenient! I always keep some in my purse and in the car when we're out and about. They are not messy, unless of course they decide to squeeze the pouch, which only happens for us when she's not hungry.<br /><br />The Plum Organics line also includes some varieties with fruits and vegetables mixed together. They taste surprisingly good and are one way to get my picky eater to eat some veggies. You can find some varieties at reasonable prices on Amazon, others are more expensive for some reason. Babies R Us has had a sale every other month or so where you can get them for $1 each if you buy them in sets of 8. That is usually when I stock up for the next two months. :)"
54747,B0040XD4RO,TERRIBLE PACKAGING - DON'T BUY IT ONLINE AT AMAZON!,Beacuse of terrible packaging the plastic bags in the boxes were opened and all my cereal was on a floor making huge mess.<br />I am very dissapointed with this order and I already left my opinion about packaging. If you can go to the store and buy it from the shelf - you will be at least able to try this cereal. I couldn't.
388622,B00432IE90,Love this,"I have been looking for this for 3 years. I can never find this locally, so know that I can get it, I'm stocking up!!!!"
468712,B000KOQJ4C,Convenient,"While the product is convenient, I could taste a bit of ""packaging taste"" along with the rice. Having purchased 12, I hope it was just a one-time occurrence!"
199860,B001E52VJS,Good energy drink,"I get only a few hours sleep a night, I needed something to get me through meetings and this really worked."
1485,B000GULKW6,Can this really be gluten free?,"I served this wonderful cake at a Christmas party at my house.  As the only celiac in the crowd, I decided to wait until the others had tried it, before revealing that it was gluten free.  Everyone raved over the great taste!  The package included directions for making the mix into a carrot cake, which is how I served it.  My own two boys said it was the best cake I had ever made, including the traditional wheat flour cakes I sometimes make for the rest of my family.  It was moist, spicy, and rich.  It reminded me of the cakes my grandmother made when I was growing up, and she was a terrific cook.  I highly recommend this one!"
560109,B003DA54NC,I'll be going through a lot of these!,"My puppy is ALL about these!  She chewed through one in a week and is halfway through her second after only 2 days (and for the record, she's a 5-lb schnoodle, not a big dog)  I suspect I'll be buying a lot of these in my future"
65620,B001EQ5Q3U,"Real tea, America!","I am not one to play the race card, but when it comes to tea I stand firmly on my Britishness.  Tetley's British Blend is real tea, not the pallid, anemic apology for tea that skulks in silly little bags (twee bags) with strings and tags and staples and other absurd paraphernalia attached, in a vain attempt to disguise the uselessness of trying to extract any vestige of taste from the contents.  These are round, robust bags that sit purposefully at the base of the cup and mean business.  They contain real tea with real taste.  Make sure the water is boiling hot when you pour it on, give the bag a minute to soak - encourage it with a little squeezing - then add a drop of low-fat milk or a slice of lemon and enjoy a true cuppa, taking time to sneer at the poor, deluded fools around you, sipping at their pathetic rosehip infusions or vanilla flavored Lobsang Souchang Rama Gupta, or whatever it is.<br /><br />The shelf life is long enough for you to buy it in bulk, and Amazon's price is good, so treat yourself to a proper cuppa.  Coffee can only start your day.  Tea can make it."
343775,B00284TTG2,Hits the Spot,I add a shot or 2 on Sat am to get me motivated and this does the trick.  Tasty too.
20291,B001BDDTB2,My cats seem to like it,"When reviewing cat food, you really can't go with taste since cat food is disgusting, but my cats really seem to like it. When I open a can they run to the bowl. Not that they don't usually run to the bowl but they are very enthusiastic about this stuff.<br /><br />The main problem I have is that it's in little cans so there's not much. I have three cats. And it's a little too watery. The food and ""gravy"" quotient is heavy on the ""gravy"" side. Also it stinks a little. Most cat food stinks but I distinctly smelled this one. So it stinks more than usual.<br /><br />Beyond that, if you can afford it and you have finicky cats, give it a shot."
419903,B001ELL3I2,"High in salt, unlike what the nutrition information says.","I bought this because there is an external site that says there is no salt, and the nutrition information says no salt. Actually each TBSP contains 680mg of salt (28% of your daily intake)."
51405,B0014UAHQM,VERY FLEXIBLE,"IN THE PAST I HAVE HAD TROUBLE WITH OTHER COMPANIES THAT WOULD REQUIRE A SIGNATURE ON DELIVERY AND IT MADE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THE PACKAGE.  BUT AFTER PLACING MY ORDER WITH THE COMPANY THIS TIME, I CALLED AND I ASKED THE WOMAN IF SHE COULD HAVE THE PKG DELIVERED WITH NO SIGNATURE.  AND SHE SAID THEY COULD DO THAT.  I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED  WHEN SHE SAID THAT.  AND SO WHEN THE PKG ARRIVED IT SAID ON THE LABEL, LEAVE NO SIGNATURE.  SO THAT MADE IT A VERY PLEASANT AND CONVENIENT EXPERIENCE.  THANK YOU"
51085,B000FIXT2I,"No flavor, suitable only as bread.","I bought this because of the rave reviews on amazon. When I actually ate a bowl, I found out that this is rice and just rice. No flavor, no seasoning, no taste. It's like buying a microwavable ""lunch"" bowl of bland, raw chicken. Why??"
467427,B0098LZ23W,Bacony cheesy oniony goodness,I just broke one of these muffins into a bowl of creamy tomato soup...like<br />having a blt/grilled cheese yummy and warms your belly.
411763,B000CQC05U,Ahhh finally truly spicy chai in a tea bag,"I once had a soy chai latte that blew my mind. I was driving through Missoula Montana. I have yearned for years to capture that taste again. I have tried chai after chai with no luck. This chai comes close. If you like spicey chai but without all the sugar and milk in the premixed, this may be your chai."
269532,B00416T8Q6,BRILLIANT,"There is no going back.  The Ceylon Cinnamon is strong/subtle, sweet/spicy.  I've added it to my morning Greek Yoghurt with honey and ground flax seeds.  Oh my!  I will always buy this!!  NO GOING BACK!!!!!"
503983,B001E4S8GO,Best conventional PB out there!,Had been buying Smuckers but all that mixing was no wearing on me.  Plus this also come in the crunchy variety.  YES! If it were not for the added sugar it would get 5 stars.
242805,B000JCIHV8,Just in time!,The box arrived on time and when they said it would. I got it just in time to wrap it up for Christmas!
1218,B005O072PC,Tasty,"Excellent and tasty though I thought not enough garlic so I added more. When I order GARLIC I guess I expect more of it.  But perfect if you have guests as it will never offend anyone. Omaha always is sure to do everything to please their customers, a premier company, hard to find anymore."
2686,B000SAPXSQ,"eliminate the ""natural flavor"" additive","Upon opening the sealed bag, I was struck by an unpleasant scent.  Looking at the ingredients I saw, in addition to the black tea and rosebuds, a ""natural flavor"" additive.  I believe this additive is the culprit to ruining what should have been a delightful bouquet to my nose.  Then I brewed this tea, and could still taste that additive, but overall the tea was tasty.  I hope the Davidson family reads our reviews because I am certain that, if they would just refrain from adding the ""natural flavor,"" I and others would find this tea to be superb, and in keeping with the other teas I have come to enjoy from Davidson's.  For example, upon opening their Darjeeling loose tea, as well as their Assam loose tea, my nose is struck with a lovely bouquet ~ this is what one wants to experience from superb teas.  I will look forward to Davidson's responding to my (and other customer's) suggestion re: this nasty flavor additive.  I've enjoyed tea with rose petals while in India, and they did not put anything other than the tea and the dried rose petals."
25084,B0081XIA1E,Two paws down,"My ten pound Yorkie is very food centric when it comes to games - if there isn't food, he isn't playing.  We have several bumble balls and kongs that he loves to play with and thought this treat wheel would be a fun new game for him.  The yellow playing pieces were much too big for him to get his mouth around and he was unable to master using his paws to flip them out of the holders.  For a dog that LOVES any game that involves food, this just proved much too frustrating for him. And believe me, we tried to help our little guy out with this. We left the yellow cups off and just slightly rotated the wheel, but even that was too difficult for him to ""spin"" as it did not move easily.  And it's not like our dog isn't ""Paw-centric"" as he is actually quite adept at using his paws to move and flip his Kong, and to fish treats out from under furniture, etc.  We tried over the course of several weeks to try and help our pal get the hang of this toy, but all parties finally agreed that this just wasn't fun the way a toy should be. Perhaps if you have a bigger dog this will work for you, but it received two paws down from our little buddy.<br /><br />One other concern that I had was the fact that the small hole in the top of the yellow cups seemed just the right opening for a dog to catch a nail in and get stuck on his paw. Granted that on one should ever leave a pet and a toy unattended, but something for people to keep in mind if they do buy this product. (yes I'm a worry wart pet parent, but you'd be amazed at the predicaments our pets have gotten themselves into...)"
543028,B002R81A16,Cheap,"I don't think this thing is meant to be smoked out of, not that that stopped me. But talk about paranoia I think the paint inside the bowl is going to kill me. But only time will tell (& if someone from my job is reading this I'm talking about tobacco)."
51667,B0002PHEU2,Great product,"A little goes a long way, I use it to flavor apple juice and 1 tsp. will work for 3 gallons of juice."
5363,B004565GV8,I really wanted to love this gum..,"Initially, the flavor is fairly accurate, however weak- from there, the flavor diminishes rapidly. I just timed it, and this gum goes flat within 5 minutes.<br />In light of my experience, I find these rave reviews somewhat... amusing; one reviewer even went as far as to describe it as ""incredibly tart"". Meh.<br />Like many new products in the realm of gum, pop, energy drinks, and fast food, they only need you to buy one. If everyone does that, they'll be sitting pretty.<br />Based on this experience, I have no desire to try the other flavors of Extra Dessert Delights.<br />Three stars = It's OK, but doesn't live up to the hype."
38777,B005JDTUX6,"bad candy, inaccurate description","For one thing, these aren't the eyeball candy I was looking for my Halloween dinner to put on my cupcake, the eyeballs are only on the wrapper, not on the candy itself.<br />Secondly, these candy taste old and yucky, the filling is very dry and stick to my teeth like crazy, I thought I'll just have to eat them since I can't use them for my cupcake decoration, but they're no good at all.<br />I could have returned it, but it doesn't even worse the trouble, so I just throw them all out in my garbage can!"
96462,B0047Z0S6A,Not Really,Tasted almost like just vanilla pudding to me.  Won't buy again .  Go back to my Hunt's tapioca Pudding cups.
8674,B003VXFK44,Wolfgang K-cup,"K-cups are marginally better than good coffee that I can buy at the store for 1/2 the price or less. This product was offered at $19.95 and I was willing to purchase it but it immediately went up to $26.95. It is not really worth $19.95 and is certainly not worth any increase. Additionally, what's the deal on offering INSTANT COFFEE in K-cups for $15.99 leaving us to think it's a good deal on REAL coffee. Do you want to lose our trust (business)???? That's a good way to do it!!!!!!!!!!<br />jb"
9044,B006N3IG4K,Great Flavor & Coffee,It's a great flavor and makes a great cup of coffee. I fine you can have more than 1 cup of this coffee and not feel like it's too much of a flavored coffee. Puck has captured a great flavor with this coffee.
312025,B000EVG8HY,Yum!!  Wish they were slightly less so!!,"Not only can't I, the celiac in the family, stop eating them; but my non-celiac husband regularly steals them before I get to them!"
57532,B001D3LV5Q,Not even fun to chew,"The sugar comes out almost immediately, then it turns into a goopy mess for the next 5 minutes until it finally starts to stiffen up. I admit I don't like gum that much, but this is awful. Maybe I just got a bad batch or something."
221865,B001FXQALO,NOT metallic,"There is nothing metallic about this color. It is gold in the fact that it is yellow, but that is it. There isn't any sheen or sparkle. I was bummed."
36421,B004CLCEDE,Diffrent,"If you have never tried these before, be wary not everyone will like them. They can be a little chewy and have a weird smell. But if you through them in a hot empty pan both of these should go away. but I would say try first then buy."
75220,B0026RQTGE,less than I ordered,"The ad says 30 regular greenies, but the package I received says<br />27 greenies."

32061,B000XEXCSA,This will most likely cause Cancer years from now but.......,"That doesn't stop the majority of us from drinking this though. Yet I write this drinking one, so I can stay up the rest of the night to write a 8-10 page research paper for my University, so what can I say? Yet as an athlete and the brother of a diabetic, I can truly say that these Monster Energy drinks are horrible for you. However, they are an addiction. Some smoke others gamble but I choose to drink Monster. It is the only energy drink I enjoy and I will most likely keep it that way."
1156,B004134H9W,Like to gamble? Buying the St. Patty's Dried Fruit Basket is a Crap-Shoot,"Buying this product seems to be almost literally like rolling the dice in a game of craps!<br /><br />My experience with this seems to be similar to the experience of ""Peter R."", unfortunately.<br /><br />The price was excellent.  I ordered mine after the date of "" J. Robert Bois'"" positive experience / review was written but before the date of ""Cindy 2366's"" positive experience / written review.  I bought these & gave them to my Dad, as he *LOVES* dates.  I noticed when I was visiting him, the dried fruit basket was hanging around in his 'fridge a lot longer than any other date basket I had ever ordered for him.<br /><br />Finally I asked him about them.  He said that he did not want to be rude to me or hurt my feelings but....  the dates, well, he was wondering if he should try & eat the seeds in the center & see if they were soft, because the dates themselves were hard as a rock & tasted stale.  I was mortified to say the least...  Then he wanted to know (jokingly) if he had done something to make me mad & I bought these for him as his punishment.  (No, but I had to laugh when he asked about that.)<br />Me personally, I have not tried them.  I will take his word for it!  :)<br /><br />I told him to throw it away or put it out for the squirrels.  After a week of offering the dates,  I picked them up out of his backyard and threw them away.  The squirrels, opossums, & raccoons declined to dine on the dates.<br /><br />It seems to be hit or miss with the ""Broadway Basketeers Irish St. Patrick's Dried Fruit Gift Basket"" purchase.<br /><br />I will not say flat out ""NO!  Do Not Purchase This Item, It is Not Good!""  That is a choice you will have to make on your own.  I just wanted to pass along my experience with the gift basket.<br /><br />Thank Goodness I caught it when it was on special & did not have the full current purchase price invested in the box!  I would have been really sad then!<br /><br />Amazon, as usual, did a fabulous job with the shipping, packaging, and they arrived quickly, in the time frame advertised / promised.<br /><br />Best of luck & I hope others have better experiences than my Dad / I had!<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004134H9W"">Broadway Basketeers Irish St. Patrick's Dried Fruit Gift Basket</a>"
2915,B000F9Z1WI,"Good, and just enough to satisfy you.","My family is on the last box.  My oldest daughter ate most of the cookies.  She likes peanut butter more than anything, and these 100-calorie pouches had just the right amount and they taste great."
78667,B00472I5A4,Kettle Chips Make Great Mouse Food,"After waiting a ridiculous amount of time for my case of 15 5oz bags to arrive, upon opening the box noticed that every bag had been chewed open by a mouse.  Don't know if it is still in the box, but it is outside on the porch.  When my son gets home, I'm going to have pictures taken and email to Amazon.  The outside Amazon box was intact, so it had to be either from the Kettle Chips people or the Amazon warehouse, don't know which.  I will never buy these again from Amazon.  I cannot tell you how disgusted I am with this purchase.  It makes me sick to think about it!<br /><br />I included pictures at the top of the page.  Poor little mousie must have high cholesterol now.<br /><br />Update:  I forgot to mention that I offered to email the above pictures of the mouse damage to Amazon but was told they didn't want them."
9705,B001LXYA5Q,"It works, but not as expected.","As other reviewers have pointed out, the effects vary from person to person. Each tablet seemed to last up to a half hour (longer for my sister)and while it did make things noticeably sweeter, the initial taste of something was identical, and it slowly got sweeter after the first half a second. Oh, and sour/bitter drinks like Monster took on a sickly sweet syrupy flavor that may leave you feeling a bit ill after. Don't try Apple cider vinegar, it tastes fine if a bit odd on your tongue, but as soon as it hits your throat the flavor and fumes were overpoweringly awful."
245706,B004OAZ36I,Definitely worth it!,Coffee arrived before said arrival date and everything is as advertised. I would definitely recommend to anyone that likes the K cup.
196176,B000FSKIOA,What real jerky taste like,S what if it is salty it is jerky.  Just eat a few pieces when you are out for a hike and drink your water.  No need to eat a whole bag at once and OD on the salt
57319,B00817GPWQ,not worth the money vey weak,"This was a very disappointing coffee.  It is very weak, I had to set my brew to a medium just to get any flavor from it and  large is very watered down. I would find something different before buying this again."

4379,B004391DK0,"good product, too expensive",The product is very good. Way too expensive and at almost 5.00 a box to get pancakes or biscuits I was disappointed

Now that I have, I could see myself buying it over and over again! It has a full-bodied flavor without the bitter aftertaste of some black teas. It's earthy without being heavy-handed or overpowering, completely unique from any other tea I've tasted. You won't find tea like this anywhere else. And though the product speaks for itself, the business model of this brand doesn't hurt: Runa buys guayusa directly from local farmers in Ecuador at fair-trade prices. Try it! It's worth every cent :)"
9518,B0001M10OW,Hardly a baking powder,"After a few uses, this powder spoilt a cake. It has lost its raising power. It is still well within the expiry date and the container has been kept closed and in a dry place. Avoid this one. I plan to ask for a refund."
26915,B004NDV46E,fight that cold!,I either got lucky twice or this stuff staves off an oncoming cold. My three grandkids are with me all the time and are all under three years old. That means a lot of colds. I got sick of being sick and decided to try this product. So far it worked. It is easy to take and tastes fine. I will be taking some tonight since all three are little snot factories again. Keeping my fingers crossed.
9080,B006N3IG4K,Amazing!,"I didn't know what this would taste like, but I'm so glad I ordered it.  What a perfect cup of yummy coffee for a cool summer morning!"
8949,B0007A0AP8,My picky dog loves these treats!,"My dog is very picky, to say the least. He's super cute, but is very picky about treats. He won't eat any biscuits, doesn't like most fake ""meat"" treats, and won't eat bacon. Because of this, he has hurt many an eager pet shop employee's feelings. However, he LOVES these treats. We just adopted him from the shelter, and his previous owners didn't teach him much. These treats are making training so much easier. He'll do almost anything for them.<br /><br />They're pretty big, so you can rip them up into much smaller pieces. They will dry out if you leave the package open, so they have to be sealed each time.<br /><br />I know I'm echoing most of the other reviews when I say this, but these are fantastic treats."

It does not cook well on high heats (as advertised), but does well at medium to low heat.  It's health benefits far outweigh vegetable oil and canola oils.  I use both this and coconut oils whenever possible for flavor."
8576,B003VXFK44,One of my favorite K-cups,This is one of my favorite K-cups.  It's a rich dark coffee without the bitterness of some.  Highly recommended.

15176,B0013E21V8,Product packaged tightly but still leaked,"The cover was slightly off tilt and the syrup leaked onto the bubble packing.  Packing was wound tightly around the container but does little for the cap not being tightened enough.  Container should have a foil safety shield installed which would end the leaking problem.  If my second auto-shipped one leaks, I will be cancelling the order.  Being opened enough to leak comprises quality, leaving it open to bacteria."
41982,B006Q7YFLQ,My four cats would not eat this,"My four cats liked the smell of these treats but they would not eat them.<br /><br />The treat to human eyes is totally unappealing. Not only are they freeze-dried raw but they look hairy (similar to a dust bunny I would find under the bed). In size, they are the circumference and height of a double-stuffed Oreo cookie. They are also very light and as easy to break up as a wafer.<br /><br />I broke several into smaller bite-sized pieces and left them out overnight.  One of my cats looked like he was going to take a bite but eventually walked away. The other three smelled the pieces and left without even trying them.<br /><br />The box of the Chicken Formula Raw Boost Bites claims these treats are for cats and dogs and are made of chicken, turkey, turkey liver, turkey heart, pumpkinseeds, apples, carrots, ground chicken bone, etc.  Each large piece is 23 calories and they recommend 1 to 2 pieces per 20 pounds of body weight.  However, since my four cats won't eat them, I'm going to throw out all this goodness to the wildlife.  Maybe some critter will eat it."
8022,B004SISLQ0,good tea,The tea is good and fresh. We enjoy it. The shipping is fast and cost is reasonable.<br />I recommend this product.
343710,B000GG5IXW,Addictive!,All I can say is this stuff is addictive! & if they ever stop making it I'll freak! It's the only tea I drink now!
6595,B002BRC562,Most awesome tasting Energy Chews we have found!,We do a lot of bicycle riding in the heat and longer rides as well. We don't want to crash from lack of carbs in our system. Other energy products don't taste as good as these do. They are conveniently packed in little pouches so they are easy to grab and take along when we ride. Good stuff!
10477,B0016J7SYU,"Yes, it's good, but. . . .","I usually order this item from Amazon since our local grocery stores (Walmart and Safeway) do not carry it, but. . .I would expect that buying in bulk would be cheaper, but instead, six bags of 26.4 ounces is eight cents PER OUNCE more expensive than buying six boxes of 11.5 ounces.  Shouldn't it be the other way around? This is not a savings at all."
81837,B005CUU25G,Not sure how to feel,"So, my dog likes it. I'll just get that out there right away.<br />But, it's awkward to carry and can be messy (which I didn't think it would be) but since you have to sometimes give it a little encouragement to get anything to come out, sometimes it just decides ""Oh you want ALL of it!"" and I have a sticky snouted puppy.<br />And, she has since lost interest in it and prefers treats she can smell better."
75729,B004MO6NI8,I will stick with 5-hour Energy Drinks,"I usually drink a 5-hour Energy drink<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GX1K14"">5-Hour Energy Extra Strength (24 Bottles Grape)</a> when I first get up so that I can quickly get in to my morning P90X routine. I put one on my nightstand before going to bed and quickly drink it down in the morning. I don't much care for the taste (though I don't exactly hate it) but I like the effect of energy drinks on my exercise performance, and that is why I decided to give this No Fear drink a try. I was disappointed and will stick with 5-Hour Energy. Here are my thoughts:<br /><br />1 - Calories: At 260 calories a can, there is a 65X difference. It does not fit in with my nutrition goals.<br /><br />2 - Taste: It's a little sweeter than a Red Bull. I don't much like Red Bull though and the flavor of No Fear was not an improvement over 5-Hour Energy.<br /><br />3 - Size: This is a BIG can yet it has roughly the same amount of caffeine, taurine, etc as 5-Hour Energy. Why drink this massive can of fluid when a small shot will do? If I REALLY enjoyed the taste, I might feel otherwise.<br /><br />4 - Energy Boost: I found the effect of No Fear to be similar to that of 5-Hour Energy.<br /><br />Bottom line: 5-Hour Energy works better for me."
9137,B006N3IG4K,Great Coffee !,"Wonderful tasty coffee with a nice aroma as it is brewing. There is no after-taste at all and it very satisfying, you always want another cup of coffee. I continue to buy it."
67512,B009GHI6I6,Kitty Junk Food,"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck."
485861,B0036BINKE,Not everyone...,"for all those saying it is too expensive, and you can get it at such and such store. You must remember it is a perishable item and not everyone has such a store close to them. Amazon will ship everywhere though and if this is what you want you will pay the extra money to have it. Im glad you are not docking the product based on price just remember that not everyone in the united states has a grocery store or walmart close to them."
26755,B004XG2H6W,"Weak lemonade, but low calorie","Lemonade is a summer staple: Tasty, cold, refreshing ... and made with LOTS of sugar. This product is sweetened with Stevia, a natural but low calorie sweetener which to me, tastes a bit like saccharine, including the aftertaste.<br /><br />When you mix this powder with 16 ounces of cold water, you are not going to mistake the result for actual lemonade. It is much weaker, and has the stevia flavor. However, its not bad either, and the calorie savings makes it a serious alternative when you have a lemonade craving. We find that if we add a few drops of RealLemon juice to the mixture, it blunts the stevia taste somewhat. We'll be drinking a lot of this throughout the summer."
7384,B001EPQQL2,Part of my greek yogurt breakfast,"My morning breakfast:<br /><br />A six-ounce container of Fage 2% plain Greek Yogurt, mixed with a sliced banana and 3 or 4 sliced strawberries.  Add a teaspoon of Splenda Brown Sugar Blend, and it's nicely sweetened, and a healthy way for me to start my day.  I started this breakfast routine over a year ago, and haven't grown tired of it.  It was suggested at a Weight Watchers meeting as a very ""low points"" breakfast.  It has easily become my ""standard"" for breakfast...so much so that I will bring a bag of Splenda with me on vacations, in case I have trouble finding it at the store.  (I also openly admit that perhaps I'm too hung up on this routine.  But it's so satisfying in the morning that I don't care.)<br /><br />I haven't personally ever cooked with this brown sugar blend, but as a topping on my yogurt or a baked sweet potato, it's been great!"
42189,B000E39T82,good substitute for broth cubes,"I bought this because I felt bad every time using broth cubes (I used ones from Rapunzel as well), because of the palm oil. This is powdered, so there is no palm oil, and I use it a lot (mostly when making seitan, rice and other dishes that call for broth)"
265079,B001E6K608,LOVE THIS CEREAL!,"NOT OFTEN TO I FIND A CEREAL TO RAVE ABOUT, BUT I GIVE THIS CEREAL RAVE REVIEWS!"
263507,B001E5E25Y,Big leaves,I haven't had any problems with this tea so I am a notch above indifferent.  I don't regret buying it.
68572,B0026LIO9A,Cat Had Bad Reaction,"My sister has been feeding our cat Zoe this product for a few months now, recently she started to get a few cysts on her body, one on her face which caused the hair to fall out in that area. when we noticed this occurring we took her to the vet asap. The vet asked what type of food we feed her and my sister informed that we use Iams Weight Control (she has trouble loosing weight) The Vet told us that she has had a few animals come in lately with the SAME problem and EATING the same food!!!! we were told to stop feeding her Iams and use an all natural cat food with only half a cup of food in her bowl each day.. I DO NOT RECOMMEND! or your pet too can start getting cysts on their body.. no good"
360760,B00020HHHC,Mom swears by it,"This was a gift for mom who had run out.  She swears by it for calming her stomach, says it still works."
63785,B002IEZJMA,tastes like a good cup of coffee - albeit cold,"I drink coffee for the flavor - I typically drink decaf and since abandoning artificial sweeteners 7 months ago, I use real sugar, sometimes cream. Since I'm unused to this volume of caffeine, it was unwise for me to consume this can late in the evening. I was wide awake all night long, unable to sleep more than a few minutes here and there.  It's unusual to get a product in a can that only has 4 ingredients as this illy issimo Caff&eacute; coffee. While it contains sugar, it was not sweet enough for me by any stretch - but I like it sweeeeet. Still, it was fully satisfying. My husband is a champion drinker of coffee. If coffee drinking were an Olympic sport, he would medal in it daily... so I let him sample this drink to get his feedback. He said he doesn't like cream in his coffee. I informed him that it didn't have any, but he insisted he could detect cream. I personally think he was thrown off by the temperature - he prefers piping hot, and I had just pulled this can out of the fridge. That being said, if you cannot tolerate cold coffee, you will not be in the market for this product. Personally, I like it at any temperature."
2636,B0016FY6H6,"YUM....Yum, Yum!!!!","This is just the quick iced tea fix I have been searching for.....it is perfectly balanced between the green tea and the natural, refreshing blueberry flavor. Keep in mind this is NOT sweet and sassy, like most instant tea ""add to bottled water"" packets. This is the real deal. If you want sweet, then order the sweet variety or add your favorite sweetener. When you add the powder, it is green....looks alittle weird, but once you can get past the looks, it's true love. I think it's delightful that I am actually consuming the entire leaf--finely ground to which it dissloves....thus making my water become murky, swamp water before my eyes!  That has to certainly be more bang for your buck for the level of antioxidants, opposed to the old brewing way.<br />  I have had a very difficult journey (until now) finding yummy, healthy (& QUICK) unsweetened flavored teas......my second favorite is the Celestial Seasonings COOL BREW bags....the blueberry green tea is also delicious, but not nearly as refined as this ""top shelf"" Stash.<br />I am pondering more flavors for my next order!"
48709,B000UGXWQ8,never again.!!,i order these for my baby shower and unfortunately  i had to buy it again from another store because out of 80 sticks only 23 came out nice and unbroken. had to pay double the price it sucks.!! never again.
4713,B00139TT72,An Awesome Awesome Dry Food For Your Dog Without Worry About Any.,It took for a week to waiting them to ship for the item but soooo pleased to myself and my dog :-) Thank you for the Newman's daughter to keeping an awesome company n' caring our pets!!!! 5 stars!
2116,B00061EXBU,Much Cheaper through Penta's Website,You can purchase this for $35.00 including free shpping straight from Penta's Website.<br /><br />I really enjoy drinking this. I can see a difference with my everyday life.
332647,B001FA1LW0,For the most part happy with the milk but...,"I wish they would have noted the expiration date, it is not even 60 days from the date of delivery."
152451,B005J6LBZ8,Better than Irish Cream,Many of us like Irish Cream in our coffee -- it takes away the bite.  Try this Chocolatey variation.  You won't be sorry.
4503,B002TMV3E4,Pretty good to go with dessert,"The main reason I drink decaf is to have the pleasure of coffee to go with dessert in the evening.  My caffeinated coffee is drunk in the morning... only one cup.  So this coffee is pretty good with evening dessert since I won't get wound up.  Flavor is good, packaged well, easy to brew."
11807,B004P4TL8E,"What can I say, this thing rocks.","Where do you put your k-cups? Right F'ing here. That's where.<br /><br />This thing is solid and doesn't slide around on the counter-top plus it's sturdy enough to handle the Platinum Keurig without issue and it looks saucey too.<br /><br />I only gave it 4 stars as the slider tray was/is a little bent. Only noticeable if you're right up next to it. Definitely not the packaging or shipping damage, looks like it came from the factory this way.<br /><br />**also, since its of stock from this store, you can find it at Bed Bad Beyond for $25**"
25148,B0081XIA1E,Not a challenge...,"I wanted a new challenge for my terrier, and she figured this out in no time flat.  Then she ran off with the compartment covers and chewed them to bits.  So, the product is not challenging and not robust.  Maybe this would work for a declawed cat, but if your dog is halfway on the ball, get something else."
439517,B000AXSG26,Tastes like Peppermint!!!,"But isn't it supposed to?<br /><br />If you want Peppermint syrup, this is for you.  Yummy!"
44642,B001EQ55RW,Yummilicious Chocolate-y Goodness,"These almonds are one of my favorite snacks. If you're trying to eat healthier but still crave a little sweetness or chocolate, this is the way to go. It can be a little dangerous to your diet if you eat TOO many at once but it makes you feel less guilty than some other snacks. I like that they aren't too sweet or too chocolate-y. You still taste the almonds despite the sweet coating. This is a product that I'll be buying again."
78934,B001E5DZSY,Great tasting popcorn,I am on a diet and this popcorn is a snack for me. It is tasty and there is hardly any un-popped kernels. I would order again.
3530,B001NH40UA,Fantastic Orange Tea,"I've ordered most of the cheaper Tea's Etc add on teas and all have been great both in terms of flavor AND value. I cold brew using disposable tea filters closed with toothpicks in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TJ3ZUA"">Takeya Airtight Drink Maker Pitcher / Jug, Set of Two</a> and it works wonderfully. (Those jugs are great, even better if you can still find them half price at Costco.)<br /><br />I'm glad I ordered this when I did, the price has more than doubled! I'd still say it's a GREAT value. This is my go to tea when I want something with a little more flavor than ""regular"" black tea. I don't sweeten my tea, but I think this would be a perfect sweet tea for a hot day. The orange flavor is very palatable unlike some others. It's noticeable without being pungent or artificial. It also isn't spiced like many other orange teas."
8020,B004SISLQ0,it is a good product,I have tried this product before and I really love it. The price is fair and I enjoy it...
6507,B000FNEX50,not what I expected,I was a bit disappointed in these.  They crumble very easily and have an unusual texture.  My son (6) does not like them.
56437,B000NME0BU,"My 12-pack came opened, with 11 cookies in it","I received a 12 pack of Mrs Fields from Amazon (fulfilled by Lakewood Candies, LLC), slightly open at the front.  Suspicious, I counted the number of cookies and realized that someone had opened up the package and pilfered one along the way...<br /><br />I won't make the mistake of trusting Lakewood Candies again."
42276,B000V1D19A,Tasty - but the Butter Chicken Curry is better,"I usually buy the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V17MLS"">Kitchens of India Paste for Butter Chicken Curry, 3.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, but thought I'd try this one.  I am a bit disappointed because I don't think it's as good.  However, I would not characterize it as bad either. It has a slight clove-ish flavor to it that I do not find unpleasant. Those who like really hot curry will probably want to add some chili flakes to it.<br /><br />When making the KOI curries I add more meat than the recipe calls for, which extends the dish without loss of flavor.  I usually serve this over rice, but I think it's good also with potatoes and peas.  Skipping the chicken altogether, this curry paste could easily be used to make a very good vegetarian curry.<br /><br />I will buy this again."
59598,B0012272NI,Awesome flavor -- better than the salty kind,"Even my family now prefers this over regular bouillon. I use it to season many dishes--eggs, meatloaf, stews, soups, as a replacement for canned chicken broth, etc. I even mix a little into melted unsalted butter to give vegetables a little extra zip. If you don't eat salt or don't want added salt, this versatile  bouillon is for you."
1879,B001RVFDOO,love em! so does my big fat belly,"I am not going to lie. I will give you the strait dope. These things are like crack.<br /><br />I will polish off about 4-5 pages of these EASILY in a day (hence the freshman 50! that I have gained!) lol.<br /><br />If you love these, I suggest balancing them out with some kind of carb blocker."
4725,B00139TT72,"Great product, my dogs love it!","I buy Newmans Own adult dog food for my two chihuahuas.  I've always fed them natural, human-grade dog food, even though most brands can be a bit pricey.  Like most pet parents, I try to do the best I can for my dogs which starts with feeding them right.  Most dog food can be disgusting and the practices behind it are disturbing.  Newmans Own is more affordable, and I feel good about the company's ethics and practices so it was worth a try.<br /><br />My dogs love it so it was easy to switch from the other brand.  They gobble it up! I now have it on subscription so we don't run out."
341921,B005GXGX8Y,are you kidding!?,"had to give it a star just to rate this but I would give it a whopping 0 stars and a capital "" YOU HAVE TO BE @#$%ING KIDDING ME!"" these milks are 4.98 a six pack at wal-mart so that means you can buy 5 / 6packs of them for 25.00 equaling 30 milks...."
20111,B0049W6ACW,SCAM.,"SHAME on you Amazon for allowing such crooked, HIGHLY over priced item to sell on your site. I'm talking about ""NESTLE COFFEE CREAMER VANILLA CARAMEL SUGAR FREE POWDER 10.2-oz. Sold by Mancor and fulfilled by.....wait for it..........Amazon.  $!5.00 for 1 10.2-oz jug, bottle, jar.  OUTRAGEOUS.  Does Amazon not screen for deceptive sale practices?"
1544,B000E7WM0K,OKAY IN A PINCH...,I bought these at walmart for less then $2.00 dollars a box.There over  $2.80 a box @Amazon for (box of six).Then you need to add another $7.00 dollars to your order to get free shipping ....I would not buy these again could be better if you added chicken or an egg like other reviewers mentioned. My box does say gluten free so maybe there are 2 versions.
3932,B0076ZJ21K,very nice plant,"cool! I got it last weekend. I was suprised about the pot size, which was a lot bigger than the regular 4"" pots. About the plant, there is nothing to complain.  Within a week, there are already new leaves!"
74413,B001BM3C0Q,STALE Tasting!,"don't be fooled and misled by believing these chips are ""healthier"" or ""better for you"". Same fat grams and calorie content...but what is worse, is that they taste stale, not enough nacho flavor and are so hard!"
68347,B003EM7J9Q,Contains MSG,These pork rinds contain MSG which is not stated on the listing.  Deceptive listing for this product.  Will not purchase again.  Shame on Amazon for wasting my money.
5384,B000H27K86,Good on Everything,"I originally discovered this years ago on vacation in southern Maryland. Since then it's always been in our cupboard. We came home to PA that year with three cans of it and then resupplied each summer. After a couple of years it became available in our area, but in the last year or so, we haven't been able to find it anywhere. This is one seasoning I don't mind buying by the case. (and it's a great price, too!)<br /><br />We put it on virtually anything - and I mean anything. Meats, poultry, seafood, salads, spaghetti, eggs, pot pie, vegetables, soups, whatever. It's especially good on any pasta dish. I even sprinkle it on a sandwich. The spice is just the right amount of heat with the touch of lemon to top it off. It sounds weird but I think I could even enjoy this on ice cream."
16075,B0054TWQ2C,Lacks flavor,"I've been a fan of Nong Shim spicy noodles for years, so when this instant version came along I had to try it. I love Korean style fat noodles and the fact that it's instant is a big plus. Unfortunately, it didn't taste as flavorful as their other lines and by comparison I find this version a little plain. No comments on the health factor since instant noodles by nature is junk food. But there's a time and place for them."
50403,B000FKIYEO,"New taste, much worse","Sorely disappointed in the new taste. Change for the worse, very much so. Not buying Altoids in light of this."
505790,B000MXJR5Y,Fish Oil in product,"The DHA in this product comes from fish oil which is not listed on the amazon site ingredients, but is listed on the package. The product is also non-returnable."
458238,B000KEVF3M,Dogs look forward to it,Been treating greenies to my pets for awhile.  They look forward to getting one in the evening.  People at the dog park remark how white my dogs teeth look.
27652,B003U0O0X0,Disappointing,"I should have listened to the other reviewers who said this was NOT the candy they remembered - but I didn't. Instead, I ended up with a bad tasting and stale (almost impossible to chew) $30 box of candy. DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!"
6117,B003L24000,Fabuloous on cat with bladder cysts,My cat suffers from bladder cysts frequently since i have used this now since november 2011 he has not had 1 attack of not being able to pass his urine. i place a few drops in his food every week. btw he does not like it but tolrates it. at first i had to use eye dropper and place a few drops in his mouth but after time he got used to it. a giant thank you this has saved me so much worry whether or not he will be ok.
52546,B003ANFMY8,Meow!,What can I say...this is the only brand of food my cat will eat. She tears into the bag by chewing on it as soon as I get it. I have to pour in into a plastic container. It also controls hair balls.
28726,B00061EOHI,terrific,"Pops pure white. No chemical taste. Butter flavor is not really buttered flavor. I've tried both and can't tell a difference. Will always buy, and have on hand, Black Jewel popcorn."
8348,B003VXFK44,"Good taste, but seals are loose so they're busting open while brewing","The vanilla coffee taste is pretty good and mild, as I expected. But I bought it for a discount from the Amazon Warehouse (otherwise K-Cups are a little expensive). When Amazon does this, it usually means they are trying to get rid of this stock quickly.<br /><br />As I expected, the expiration date is for a month or two from now, so they were trying to get rid of them. I also noticed the seals didn't seem as tight as they normally are. This also could be because it was sitting in Amazon's warehouse in the heat all summer.<br /><br />As I expected, about half of these K-cups burst open while brewing. (This is not usual, and I've tried many different brands.) This made them leak (so clean-up was kind of annoying) and not taste as fresh, but it still tasted decent. Bottom line: When K-cups are discounted from Amazon Warehouse, be ready to pay in other ways! lol"
194203,B0009Y8AGI,really helpful,"The tea definitely works for me, I can tell for I pump only and see the amount of milk going up.  I take the tea with honey and lemon and like the taste.  Would recommend to nursing mothers."
44771,B001EQ55RW,Great taste and a great almond!!!,Use these almonds everyday as a snack. Leave them at home and measure 1/4 cup of nuts out for a snack to take to work with you during the day. Do not keep them on your desk because you wont stop eating them!!

345729,B000ED9L9E,great product outstanding price,I've been eating oat bran for health reasons for quite a while. Buying this product through Amazon is saving me quite a bit of money.
110024,B007PA30ZU,Ridiculous Price,"This item is way over priced.  Don't pay $1 / cup.  You can get it around $0.60 / cup anywhere else online.  If you are paying $1 / cup, you might as well go to Dunkin Donuts."
66673,B000LR2QW2,If you knew how it was produced,"If you knew how foie gras was produced, you probably wouldn't buy it. Ducks are intensively raised from birth, their toes cut off so that their talons don't have to be maintained. They are manhandled so forcefully that many ducks break wings or legs or sometimes even necks. They are forced into individual cages and remain there, until they are forcefed fat through long metal tubes, to swell their livers. They are given so much food that they struggle to breathe. This happens 3 times a day. Sometimes, the ducks don't survive this maltreatment, and their bodies are thrown into wastebins.<br /><br />I am not a vegetarian but I believe that it is wrong to intensively raise animals in this way. Please show your support and boycott the sale of foie gras."

2514,B0079LSXQ6,Tasty,"I picked up a box of this in a discount grocery store in paso robles. The cake was heavenly. I liked it so much, I found another store that sold the mix as well as the icing, and there is even a pink lemonade cookie mix which I bought but haven't tried yet.<br /><br />The taste, is of course lemon, but it reminds me a bit of that flavored mix Country Time I drank as a kid, but less tangy. Its very light and refreshing.<br /><br />I simply loved it. Hope this is more than just a seasonal flavor."
153275,B00024CW1O,We like this option,"We have added coconut oil to our diet, and my husband prefers the capsules to eating it on his food.  This works for us."
14888,B0012ZJ4S6,Tastes *nothing* like Sencha!,"For anyone who is a seasoned Sencha tea drinker, this is tea is a total dud.  It barely tastes anything like fresh, high quality Sencha nor even older dried sencha leaves.  I had to throw this in the trash because it's simply dreadful."
3127,B000FDKQCY,An excellent bread machine mix.,"I have tried many bread machine mixes and most have been okay but this one rates an ""excellent"" because not only is it a very good basic loaf, it also works very well with additives, either prepared entirely in the bread machine, or (after the second rise) removed from the machine, shaped and baked on a stone in the oven.<br />Stretched and flattened with a filling of either savory or sweet ingredients, then rolled and set to rise and then bake in a loaf pan, it produced excellent herb and onion bread, cinnamon raisin bread and a brown butter and seed bread.<br />I buy it via the subscribe-and-save plan as I use it often."
76536,B001B0W0W4,sooooooo much fun!!,i purchased this for my indoor cat silver he loves it!!!worth every penny i hung it on my door and for a week all we heard was squeaking but the it stopped he played with it so much he broke the noise box by sling shooting it so hard into the door and eventually the string broke and he took it somewhere a month later we found it wrapped around my mothers bed post now we just use it as a hand held teaser

8701,B003VXFK44,great decaf coffee!,"Wolfgang Puck coffees are very good. This particular flavor of decaf is delicious - doesn't taste like decaf at all, very rich & flavorful. Also, this was a very good value for the price. I've recommended this product to several friends."
6513,B000EZOO30,Much better than garlic powder!,"I used to buy this product at the local WalMart, but they no longer carry it.  It delivers more garlic flavor per ounce than ordinary garlic powder, and I use it whenever fresh garlic is not practical...on my burgers, in potato salad, etc."
323130,B000OQ2DL4,Calm it works!,"I have used this before, it keeps me from getting leg cramps. I have used it for several years. I find that when I am dieting I tend to get leg cramps at night, taking this nightly completly stops them."
60439,B003QNJYXM,Works gr8!,"I'd about had it for today, just after lunch. My eyes were heavy and my brain was fuzzy. Having a boring work day didn't help one bit. I have also been fighting nodding off while driving (YIKES) every day of the last week. I took a shot of 5 hour energy around 2pm. I am now fully awake and glad I didn't try to drive home sleepy once again. All the flavors have a bite, but I put mine in the fridge when I get here and it takes the edge off the flavor by the time I'm ready to shoot in the afternoon. I don't notice the transition from sleepy to awake or when it's wearing off. This stuff rocks! Too bad about the cost tho."
451034,B002YZXU4W,My daughter's favorite snack.,My 18-month daughter LOVES the strawberry mango. I have to hide them from her to avoid battles at the end of snacktime!
4375,B004391DK0,Amazingly Good,"My wife and daughter are Celiac but my son and I are not. We have been using Bob's Red Mill GF pancake mix and it's pretty good but you can tell it's gluten free. The pancakes we made today with this Bisquick mix were amazing. My mother, my son, and I could barely tell them from the normal wheat version on flavor. The texture is a bit different but they're light and fluffy unlike a lot of overly dense GF versions. We'll definitely be stocking up on this and using it with some of the old stand-by regular Bisquick recipes to see how it works in them."
44749,B001EQ55RW,BEWARE ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS!,"When these came out I couldn't get enough of them... until I read the ingredients. THERE ARE ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS IN THIS ""HEALTHY"" SNACK! I stopped cold turkey! Still jonesing for them when I pass them in the store isles. But, I just found here on Amazon that Blue Diamond puts one out as well with no BAD ingredients, according to their website. Gonna give them a try. EMERALD IS CHEATING & MISLEADIING! They know what they're doing. That's like the MSG flavoring in Chinese food...BAD!"
56366,B003OB2H1M,Flavourless rubber,"There's really not much to it than the title. It says extra flavour, but its so bland and if you don't time it well,  the noodles go from rubbery to soggy in a split second.<br /><br />I don't usually care enough about instant noodles to want to write a review, but this was pretty bad. But I suppose for the price, it keeps you full."
449405,B000LKZK36,GROSS,I bought all different flavors of jerky from this brand and it is sooo gross. I had to spit it out. Never again.

Where's the list of ingredients?<br /><br />I don't eat anything unless I know and approve of what's in it.<br /><br />For example, although this product's description says it contains no sugar, it does not say if it contains any artificial sweeteners, which are also bad for you.<br /><br />For one thing, aside from tasting awful, artificial sweeteners often cause horrendous intestinal cramps and diarrhea.<br /><br />In addition to having long ago given up the eating of sugar and sugar in all its guises (e.g: ""natural"" cane juice, fruit juices, ""raw"" sugar, ""organic"" sugar, etc.), I also stopped ingesting artificial sweeteners of any kind.<br /><br />So, what's in this stuff?"
7028,B004K30HO2,good alternative,I really enjoy this disposable. The only thing that would make it better would be for the cups and lids to be made out of a more eco friendly material. Coffee tastes great.
355963,B002QWP8H0,Always a great choice,I buy these time and time again. I noticed an immediate improvement in my dog's breath (no stink...he gets in my face all the time) and there's no plaque on his teeth.

6428,B000OIT8T2,skittles are tasty!,"I have an interesting relationship with Skittles.  When I was about 10 years old, I absolutely thought they were average at best and couldn't understand what everyone loved so much about them.  ""Too sour, not tasty enough"" was my impression.  Later however, I entered my teenage years and it actually took until I nearly graduated from high school that the taste caught on with my tastebuds and became super delicious to me.  What also got me hooked is this kid I remember from 10th grade science class who would ALWAYS bring in a bag of Skittles *every single day* and chew on them, and all the girls liked him because of his good looks and smooth personality, so Skittles sort of gave me the impression that COOL kids eat Skittles.  However, please buy bags of Skittles from your local grocery store- it's not worth it here on amazon with the high dollar price.  You can find plenty of places in your area selling them for cheaper prices.  My only complaint with Skittles is that, despite the color, they *all* taste exactly the same to me!  Purple, green, red, orange, yellow... I really can't taste a difference between these supposed ""different flavors"".  Then again, I don't have a favorite color in a rainbow so maybe this makes perfect sense!"
2056,B001E5E29A,Best Breakfast,I have used this product for a few years now. This being the first time from Amazon. I'm glad it was there. This is by far the best pancake/waffle mix on the market bar NONE !

8977,B0007A0AP8,Pick dog pick,I had a really picky dog who refuses any kind of biscuit type treat offered to him.  He eats some soft treats and loves these.
8945,B0007A0AP8,Dogs love these!,"We normally don't buy expensive treats (tend to stick to dry biscuits), but we got these for all of the family dogs as stocking stuffers for Christmas. They were a huge hit! Our dog is willing to do anything imaginable to get one of these. My boyfriend's mom, who totally spoils her Portie, hadn't seen these before, and her dog loved these like crazy as well, so she went out bought a bunch more when they ran out. Also, they're natural and there are no shady ingredients, so they are good for your pooch!<br /><br />Just to clarify, these don't actually have the consistency of jerky. They are little squares of what looks like pressed meat product. Clearly, our dogs do not care and consume these with great enthusiasm, so still very highly recommended!"
1057,B001SAX7Z6,Great fat free and spicy!!!,"Riba foods based in Houston, Texas makes this awesome black bean dip. It is pretty much all natural and without the lard that regular refried bean dip has in it. I am not sure why in Dallas TX it's so hard to find - maybe because Riba has SO Many good flavors??? I make the traditional 7-layer dip with this instead of the refried beans, and am thinking about creating a breakfast quesadilla with this and some verde sauce. Try it, it's not too too spicy but is very good!"
5048,B0026RHUP8,Enfamil Premium Power 23.4 can - 6 pk,"Be careful when odering this, because they say it's a 6 pk, but you will only get a 4 pk, plus the formula goes out in 4 months.

8503,B003VXFK44,"Mmm, mm, great coffee aroma!","While looking for a top rated vanilla K-cup, I stumbled upon this combination flavored cup that was rated higher than any of the vanilla flavored cups at that time.  I took a chance and ordered a double pack from Amazon and was pleasantly surprised. This is a rich tasting medium/light roasted flavor that appeals to several coffee drinkers at our house. There is a hint of built in sweetness so that additional sweeteners are not necessary for those of us who don't care for super sweet coffee. I would classify this as a medium roast and tastes best with the medium sized cup selections on our Keurig Coffee Brewer<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTR2F6"">Keurig B-70 B70 Platinum Single-Cup Home Brewing System</a>. People who prefer extra bold coffees would need to use two of these K-cups to make one extra large travel mug of coffee.<br />  That said, we have found that mixing this flavor with other flavors to make an extra large serving is a most enjoyable pastime at our house. The most popular combo's so far are Jamaica me Crazy with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00395DVQS"">Van Houtte French Vanilla K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, Hazlenut<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00395574M"">Van Houtte Hazelnut Decaffeinated K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a> or Costa Rican<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HKZZ4I"">Van Houtte Caf&eacute;, Costa Rica Tarrazu (Light Roast), 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>.

33949,B00412W76S,No taste or flavor,I had a hard time drinking this tea as it tastes like cardboard! There's no taste or flavor. I don't know if it actually works to strengthen the uterus as I wasn't able to make myself have it for the couple of months required. I'm not sure if all raspberry tea tastes like this or just this brand.
7096,B004K30HO2,Spews coffee grounds inside Keurig machine K-cup holder and down into my coffee every time!,"I thought these would be the perfect answer. Sadly, I guess the pressure with which my Keurig machine shoots the water through the k-cup is too much for the disposa cup, because every single time I tried it, coffee grounds were spewed up through the tiny hole in the lid of the disposa cup all over the inside of where the k-cup sits in my keurig. And yes, I used them properly.<br /><br />So the issue, at least in my Keurig machine, seems to be with the lids. Some have suggested its a design flaw with the Keurig machine. In either case, these disposa cups were NOT the answer for me.<br /><br />Biggest waste of money ever. I cannot recommend."
5880,B004S7MLQC,too much for too little,This product was okay tasting. My problem with it was the 10 oz container with less than 6 oz of sprinkles. Really?!?

510396,B001445YSY,Moon Pies,I bought these for my college class that was reading 'Rocket Boys' because Moon Pies are mentioned.  I thought the students would get a better idea of that time period.  The pies bordered on stale and the students did not like the banana flavor.  I would order again hoping that they would be fresher.
48086,B004SRH2B6,addicting!,One word--hooked!<br />And I was really shocked that it wasn't so heavy in calories and sugar but still creamy tasting-<br />Good addition to my morning shake or when i can't resist that damn reese cup.

55730,B00141QYMC,FDA says pet death toll from jerky treats now at 360,"Dogswell jerky treat come China.  They are not safe.  I've had a subscribe and save subscription for the product, but I've calcelled after reading this story from September 15, 2012.  (Just search for the article's title, which is the same as my review.)<br />----<br />The FDA now says 350 dogs and one cat have died in the last 18 months, reportedly after eating chicken jerky treats made in China.<br /><br />An FDA report released this week says they've received 2,200 reports of illnesses linked to the treats - the deaths are included in that number. There is no geographic pattern to the illnesses and deaths - cases have been reported from all 50 states and 6 Canadian provinces.<br /><br />The FDA says the majority of complaints involve chicken jerky (treats, tenders, and strips), but others include duck, sweet potato, and treats where chicken or duck jerky is wrapped around dried fruits, sweet potatoes, or yams.<br /><br />The report goes on to say that in the past 10 years, there has been a dramatic increase in importation of pet food from China. It is estimated that nearly 86 million pounds of pet food came from China in 2011. Pet treats, including jerky pet treats, are currently considered the fastest growing segment in the pet food market.<br /><br />The FDA has been investigating the reports of illnesses, but no definitive cause has been determined.<br /><br />""The ongoing global investigation is complex, multifaceted and includes a wide variety of experts at the FDA including toxicologists, epidemiologists, veterinary researchers, forensic chemists, microbiologists, field investigators and senior agency officials,"" the report says.<br /><br />The FDA says product samples have been tested for contaminants known to cause the symptoms and illnesses reported in pets, and they are now expanding testing to include irradiation byproducts and they are consulting with NASA experts about it.<br /><br />In their report, the FDA says jerky treats are not necessary for pets to have a balanced diet - basically advising people not to feed them to their pets. But if you choose to give your pet the treats,  watch them closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination."
19358,B003ZNRDPE,This is made in China!,Very disappointing. It initially seemed like a good and healthier alternative to rawhide. I am extremely unhappy that this item is made in China!  I NEVER give my pets anything made in China.  There is much information out there about pets becoming ill and dying from products made in China.
2287,B003YMAET8,Watch out for the FAT!,"Traditional English Muffins are usually fat free or having very little fat.  This little challenger should be called something else all together.<br /><br />Closer to what I would say a croissant is, having all of the buttery taste and fat to go with it.<br /><br />Terrific if that's what you are looking for in an English muffin but not what I'm looking for.  I would rather save the fat for a chocolate dessert."
10349,B003EML8PM,Never again...,"Wow, I had high hopes for a great addition to my low carb diet, but these rinds were very disappointing.  Tried several bags, but could not get the cooking time right.  Taste was dreadful, texture downright rocky.  I guess I'll stick to off the shelf rinds.  Won't be getting these again.  Can't recommend, and would warn of anyone asking for my opinion."
55922,B003EX2ECM,This is disgusting and harmful!,"This is outrageous that the compound sold here can be added to meat parts to make them a ""whole"" product. The separation of parts to be rejoined is HIGHLY likely to cause sickness in people, such salmonella, e coli, etc. This product should be BANNED in the US and everywhere else, as it is a human hazard, not only in chemical composition, but in the practice of butchery in every place worldwide. Really."
6191,B000UOFW9K,great chips but terrible shipping,The chips are awesome.  I first bought them at Costco and now I cannot get them there any more.  The bags at Costco were about 3 times larger than the one I recieved from Amazon.  The arrived mostly in tiny crumbles of chips and the bags were about 1/3 full.  I won't waste my money buying them from Amazon again as the shipping is just not up to par.  If you can find the chips retail I would advise buying them that way.  Their website says that super target and Costco carries them but have not been able to find them there recently.

2780,B000J2DQ46,Tasteless,"I'm a little perplexed by all the great reviews.  This was the most bland chowder I've ever had.  I prepared it with just milk and a little butter, and it tasted like nothing!  Added some salt and white pepper, still nothing.  Added some black pepper and Provence herbs, now it tastes like herbed potato soup.<br /><br />On the plus side the clams were nice big chunks and the potatoes were tender.  The consistency was pretty good too.  It just had no flavor.  Not going to be buying this again, certainly not when it's this expensive, too."
79707,B0061UQBSS,"Great Product, bad price","I have purchased these 3 or 4 times by now in bulk.  It tastes just like a starbucks cup of coffee, and cost about the same per cup.

926,B000ER6YO0,Had to toss 9 out of 12 jars,Only three jars came in a form edible to babies.  The rest of them were filled will a clump of spongy mush that would not mix with the water.

222205,B001HTGAQQ,My son loves these!!!,We were paying 3.99 a box at the grocery store.  This is a terrific value.  My autistic son is on a Gluten-Free diet and absolutely loves these.  His sister who is not on the diet prefers these too.

36755,B001HTJ2BQ,so disappoointing,"So, after reading every review, I checked to see that the country of origin listed in the description was Thailand. I tried not one but a replacement case as well, both a horribly greasy product from Sri Lanka. Amazon immediately reimbursed me. I had used this product before (not from Amazon) and my cans must have been from Thailand as the product is (was)so dreamy I really wanted it again.<br /><br />I decided to call the company because their description on Amazon is false advertising. The woman I spoke to was an absolute brat, borderline rude, with excuse after excuse. Maybe she was tired of fielding complaints, but isnt' that her job? I was so surprised because I have had such great conversations and learned so much from other small companies like that--like Nutiva (who I complained to about my leaking coconut oil and devleoped a great relationship with one of the representatives there who sent me a replacement even though I told him Amazon had already reembursed me. I just wanted to let them know about the problem.<br /><br />Her biggest excuse (among several side-stepping maneuvers) is that the sample sent to them did not match the product. To me this speaks VOLUMES about the lack of quality control at the company. Makes me wonder what is in those cans. So, Amazon and other poor consumers will have to suffer for Edward and Sons faulty business products until the Sri Lankan is used up 'in about another month or so'. Seriously?<br /><br />A small company with poor customer service is doomed to fail, no matter how great their product. And with a lousy product like this I am unwilling to try any of their other things if they don't stand behind their products."

32562,B001VIWU76,Dissappointed,I have eaten Kopali Organic Mangos from grocery stores like Whole Foods before and they were excellent. The ones I received were horrible. I had different members of my family try them and they felt the same way. Then when I tried to return the remaining packages Amazon could not find my account and by the time it was straighten out it was too late to return them. I will not be purchasing food items from Amazon again.
263529,B0029O6YK0,Cheaper at Walmart.com,Walmart.com has this for $4.88 for a box of 12 packs.  It was even cheaper at my local grocery store.  Amazon is ripping us off.
6896,B001LG945O,No.,"I thought it would have a clean, crisp taste, but it honestly tasted just like every other orange soda I've ever had.  Maybe that's deliberate; maybe they're targeting people who would otherwise drink orange soda, unless presented with a more ""natural"" alternative...  Regardless, it tastes exactly like carbonated reconstituted juice concentrates, with some orange coloring thrown into the mix, i.e., nothing special."
49782,B000CRHQN0,Freshness questionable,"Bars appear to have been either mishandled in storage/transport, or they are just old.  Bars on surface should be uniform chocolate color but instead are dry and ashy.  This is a disappointment, considering I ordered a whole case.  Taste is also dry."

13207,B000CDNL8I,"No competitors from which to choose, but fine for what it is","First: we are talking about a shaker of actual gold flakes. Anything negative probably falls into the category of, ""Seriously? You just bought a shaker of GOLD FLAKES."" That being said, the shaker itself could be better; the flakes come out all right and not too clumpy, which is good--I'm using these for a specialty cocktail--but I have a feeling about 30% of the gold I just paid an outrageous sum for is going to end up stuck to the sides of the shaker with no way to extract.<br /><br />Also. I know it's real gold, but this price is just silly. I can't use the candy gold flakes for my purpose so I'm stuck with these guys, and I do appreciate they make a hard to find product, but their margin must be astronomical."
7736,B001E5DZTS,a godsend for infants!!,"My 5mo daughter has a severely sensitive stomach associated to an iron intolerance. She's been formula fed since the beginning due to my personal choice. I went through 8 different commerical milk-based and soy-based formulas. A good friend of ours suggested goat's milk. Her nephew was a failure to thrive baby and the ONLY formula he didn't throw up was Goat's Milk. I can easily find the liquid Goat's Milk at our local grocery store. Unfortunately, I have yet to come across the powder at said grocery store. I was home visiting my parents and was in search of the liquid, but found the powder. Strange that a smaller grocery store in a much smaller metropolitian area would have the powder versus a very large grocery store in the US's 4th largest metropolitian who just has the liquid.<br /><br />Anyways, after 8 weeks of trial & error, we have a very happy 5mo baby. I wish would have found this milk earlier.<br />I added a mixture of goat's milk and pulp-free, plain coconut water into my daughter's feedings and it not only has cleaned her system out, but has stopped the colic, vomiting, reflux, constipation AND to replace her electrolytes. Again, I will repeat. Lower iron content equals happier, calmer baby. We still have the lingering green poops compliments of the iron oxidation; however, the iron tolerance has been greatly minimized. No colic, no vomiting, no reflux and no constipation. She has one bottle of coconut water/goat's milk every day just to keep the GI tract from metabolizing the excess iron proteins and to replace her ever so important electrolytes. Ironically, she actually takes this formula mixture better than the traditional formulas!!"
1357,B005151BV6,"Great flavor, shipped fast",Definitely would reorder these again.  I think it would be better if they were offered in a bigger pack.  My kids love these.  Great little Valentine's Day gifts.  Great stocking stuffers.
37062,B000BYPF7S,Happy Dogs!,"Hard to find sturdy toys for big dogs....  but these bones are my dog's favorite!  I have purchased sterilized bones in the past, and they lasted for years.  My dog loves these, and they have already lasted longer than other chews I have purchased...  I expect him to have years of chewing satisfaction..."

12459,B0079YD36I,Coffee Lovers Beware,"I purchased this coffee on sale at my local Vons. They had it on sale for $4.99 a bag so I bought four bags -- can't beat that price, right? I figured, how bad could it be?<br /><br />It is beyond bad. First, if this is ""French Roast"" coffee than I'm Angelina Jolie. There is not on identifiably French Roast aspect about it. The taste is nothing short of horrid. I tried making a pot with more coffee and one with less coffee. Nothing worked -- it's just awful.<br /><br />I am taking back the three unopened bags as this is just undrinkable. I threw the open bag away.<br /><br />This is how bad it is: I have a can of Folger's in my pantry for those emergency mornings when you wake up and learn you're out of coffee. I poured out the Gevalia and made a pot of Folgers and it was better than the Gevalia. Since Folger's is barely drinkable, imagine how horrid Gevalia is.<br /><br />Save your money. It's not even worth buying when it's on sale."
24891,B004NRW7TS,Terribly Wrong,"I strongly suspect this caviar, which is widely available in US supermarkets is a reason for fear of caviar in 90% of American population. This product only resembles real caviar in shape and color (artificial). It would not qualify for caviar in Europe. It's from the wrong fish, it has totally wrong taste, and it also has whole periodic table on the label. It's like dying chicken breast into red color, marinating it in steak souse, and selling it as New York Strip Steak...<br /><br />Real caviar doesn't come from lumpfish, and real caviar only have two ingredients - caviar and salt. Try Red Pearl Salmon Caviar if you want to try caviar. You can easily find it on Amazon and other places online."
100968,B000Z4SWII,Great Tea,Bought two cases and already went through one of them. It also appears cheaper hear than on the company website.
15519,B000255OIG,THE BEST healthy dog treat!,"This is the ONLY dog treat that my Lhasa Apso will eat. It makes me happ becuase it has NO added ingredients or preservatives, as well as NO ADDED SALT! This is the ONLY dog treat that my Vet approves of!"
79808,B001IZM92S,NOT my favorite,"Was very excited for these to come, however when I got them. I was NOT happy, not a good flavor or texture."
22153,B000KV61FC,just ok - my 2 dogs are not the least bit interested in it,"Well, this was purchased to keep our two canine ""monkeys"" busy while we're out. Even after filling the toy with the YUMMIEST treats (dried chicken jerky) and showing both dogs what to do they gave up after only a few minutes... no go"
5231,B0009OMU00,Wonderful blend of flavors!,"This is an addicting, fantastic snack mix. It has a wonderful variety of crackers and blend of flavors."
541821,B001FZ0T1E,YUM YUM,OUR BEAGLE JUST  LOVES THIS PRODUCT<br />SHE TAKES ONE WITH HER WHEREVER SHE GOES<br />ESPECIALLY LIKES O CHEW WHILE IN THE CAR
8794,B000M5PP8U,Wholly underwhelming,"I am not happy about writing this review. I had very high expectations from both the name and the high praise given by the other reviewers. I was at once concerned, however, based on the weak aroma at first opening. And, these initial concerns were confirmed at first use... little flavor here. I have found a home recipe based off of the ingredient list with stuff from my spice rack produces a much better result.<br /><br />Beef Rub: Brown sugar, sea salt, paprika, chille, rosemary, fresh garlic, chipotle powder, cumin, and McCormick Montreal Steak Seasoning.<br /><br />Chicken Rub: Brown sugar, paprika, sea salt, chille, McCormick Montreal Chicken Seasoning, curry, garlic, cinnamon, and Chinese Five Spices."
5479,B00622CYVI,Great variety.,I like this one better than all the other ones by Earths Best. The variety is good and my son seems to enjoy them all.<br /><br />If i am going away for a weekend this is perfect for feedings. It is packaged well and again the variety helps!
411765,B000CQC05U,Triple Bergamot,"I like this tea. Whenever I pull a bag out of it's foil envelope, i like to inhale the scent of the Bergamot Oil.  Triple Bergamot ?  Bring it on !"
69701,B003CK7O36,"As good as Bentley's, MUCH cheaper at Amazon.com.","I never liked Earl Grey til I had Bentley's.  It was a gift, far too expensive for my daily tea.  This Stash DOUBLE BERGAMOT is just as good and so much cheaper.  I ordered 200 bags because I drink it every day.  It's all about the Bergamot; otherwise it's just black tea.  This product gives you that pronounced Bergamot flavot that makes it special.  Don't be afraid to buy a large quantity.  You won't be disappointed.but beware:  you may become addicted."
25122,B0081XIA1E,No good,"My dog figured this out in 20 secs and quickly lost interest right after. Just spinnning a little opens up ALL the food compartments. Also, its hard to get at some of the food given how narrow the opening is. Would not recommend."
80724,B003YZ4LN0,"Beware of the ""2""","Apparently there is a second version of this, as evidenced by the ""2"", as in ""React 2"".  The 2 version is pretty bad compared to the non-2 version, IMO.  5... what a horrible idea."
4251,B004391DK0,great gluten free dairy free option to make lots of yummy food!,"We LOVE the new gluten free Bisquick! I used to for cheddar biscuits mostly until we found out that we had a milk protein intolerance. Now, we are using this to make so many more recipes because it is dairy free and from what I can tell allergen free. The only thing I would like better (General Mills-if you are listening-I know I am not the only one that wants this) is if it came in bulk packaging. Just put the GF Bisquick in a larger box like the regular Bisquick and then sell in a 3 or 6 pack. Just mark that this review was helpful if you agree and maybe GM will listen! LOVE THIS-ORDER NOW!!"
4556,B002TMV3E4,"Wonderful aroma and taste, but be careful opening the bag","I'm far more of a tea drinker than a coffee drinker, but I can't start the day without a cup or three of coffee. Plus, I'm not really awake until I smell the coffee brewing - just not morning without it.<br /><br />I tend to buy more affordable (e.g., supermarket type brands) of coffee so I can splurge on tea. So this was a real treat - outstanding aroma just opening the bag, and even better when brewing. Delightfully smooth taste, and highly drinkable black (the only way I drink coffee or tea).<br /><br />My only complaint is opening the bag. Based on what other reviewers stated, I opened it over a plastic bin so it would catch any spills. Very glad I did - an appreciable amount was spilled when I cut into the bag. I decanted it into an air-tight container. I've had this problem with other vacuum packed coffee, but the very fine grind of the Melitta made it even more of a problem.<br /><br />Still, not enough of a problem to warrant taking away a rating star. This makes a wonderful cup of coffee!"
4745,B00139TT72,Dog doesn't like it,"This food might have great contents, but my 7 1/2 lb, 11/2 yr old poodle doesn't like the taste. She's not a picky eater."
16970,B000OM8IFS,Delicious for just about anything,"Forget about just using it with milk and hot water, I put it in smoothies even when I put acai and other fruits in. I was just disappointed the way they shipped it, in a USPS Priority Mail envelope. They charge almost $10 for shipping, and I would expect it to come at least in a box, not just squeezed into a thin cardboard envelope. Otherwise, no complaints about the product, delicious."
32797,B0083QJU72,GREAT PRODUCT,"Quality product at the right price. I've been part of the subscribe & save program for this organic maple syrup for over a year now. It's an expensive syrup, but very mineral-rich and we use it sparingly--so it works for our family."

438344,B000WFKZA8,Great Price on royal Canin Dog Food,"This is one of the highest rated quality dog foods. The Amazon price was lower than PetsMart's price, even including the shipping charge. Well packaged, arrived when promised."
2173,B000N5XCPM,Grammy's Pot Pie for Dogs - Dogs Love It!,This canned food has real chunks of chicken in it.  Dogs love it.  Looks and smells better than human-quality canned beef stew (like Dinty Moore).

9160,B006N3IG4K,Best Vanilla  K-Cup Coffee Ever!,I've tried all Vanilla coffee K-cups and by far this is the best! Wolf Gang Puck Vanilla Francaise is a smooth vanilla experience that lasts way after the coffee is consumed.  Try it you'll love it!
3834,B000X2CWTM,Licorice,This licorice is great.  It taste like the old fashion rope licorice. I will continue to buy it.
50959,B00139C3P2,Firm stool,"Following a year with my adopted 8 year old Persian mix and his incredibly loose stool, three weeks after adding Mr. Newman's to his diet he has a firm stool. We tried Science Diet IM and WD a combination of wet  and dry.  I continue to  feed him the WD dry with a 1/3 of a can Newman's twice a day. Not that this cat is a picky eater but he cleans the bowl with Newmans and he always left a bit behind with ID. My cat is happier and I am  so happy that his obligatory butt cleaning scoots have ended."
9143,B006N3IG4K,Great blend of flavor.,"There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said. But when I brewed this coffee I really wasn't expecting to like it at all, seeing as I don't normally like coconut flavored things. But I really like the blend of flavors. To me it doesn't really taste like coconut as much as it does just tropical-ness in general. It's like.. palm tree flavored coffee. And the flavor isn't too overpowering at all, it still has a nice coffee taste. It's just right."
5894,B003KLSZGW,Delicious crispbread,"Thanks to the wonderful reviews I read about this crispbread, I decided to purchase. There are many other crispbreads/crackers that I've purchased that taste like cardboard and have little flavor.  I think this crispbread is really delicious - a little sweet with lots of crunch and a variety of seeds. Great flavor.  I like that it's organic, whole grain, and relatively high in protein.  It's a little different from other crackers and it is great topped with egg or tuna salad or all by itself. Delicious! I will have to try some of the other Doctor Kracker Crispbreads. I will certainly be ordering more of these."
38353,B007R1PGVS,zip fizz,The product was wet in the tube as if the tube was not seiled correctly.

2559,B000ED9LDU,Very healthy!,Great for you! Grind them up and add a few tablespoons. Can't tell it's there in your cereal ect..
8417,B003VXFK44,Great Taste and Reasonably Priced,"I personally don't like strong coffee.  If you like weaker coffee, then this blend is a great choice for you.  Other reviews on here say that its too weak, which is probably true if your used to something strong.<br /><br />I also use flavored creamer to further enhance the taste. For the price, it can't hurt to give it a try."
52258,B000H27PAO,I thought I hated milk chocolate,"I thought I hated milk chocolate...until I had this bar!  I've had really bad experiences with American milk chocolate bars being too sickingly sweet in the past, but it all changed one day when I went to Asia last year.  One day when I was browsing a supermarket for a chocolate bar to satisfy my craving, this was the only type of foreign chocolate bar available.  I decided to try this bar due to its brand popularity and at the same time avoiding the rows of Hersheys and Dove chocolates I've seen all over the U.S.<br /><br />Oh my gosh.  Can we say mouthgasm?  On a MILK chocolate bar?  Needless to say, I am no longer snooty toward milk chocolate.  This bar is amazingly rich without being too sweet, and entire hazelnuts scattered throughout the bar just make it taste even better and further helps combat the added sweetener in the bar.  At the price of roughly $2.70 a bar, I definitely think this is a steal.  I do want to give a warning about it melting easily, so be careful about shipping in hot weather."
291258,B0086FQYAQ,fan's view,I prepared it as Dr. Oz suggested. I began to lose weight but had to stop drinking it because it raised my blood pressure.I am hypertensive.
124427,B000O5FTYI,My Cat Loves these,"I was already buying them at the store, but had to go to a pet store to find them. I ordered them here to save me a trip to a place that I only need to get 1 item from. The price was about the same as I paid in the store, but I like the fact that I can just order it at home and it shows up at my house. That is the BONUS for me."
5893,B003KLSZGW,Decilious,These are delicious and filling. I first had them in Hawaii a few weeks ago but then couldn't find them when I got back home to Philly. Amazon had them and a good selection. If you are a seed and nut eater and like a crispy cracker you will love these. Enjoy!
6522,B003JYEL2W,not as good as it usually is,I love Community Coffee but the batch I received of the Special Decaf was old the bags had lost their vacuum packed state.
37478,B0031M94OC,Oggi Salad dressing bottle - not so pretty,The bottle itself works well - the lid seems to give a tight seal. But the recipes and measures printed on the outside are a bold black and give it an extremely functional look
7574,B000ELWDR8,"good soup, too many dents","The photo shows potato and carrot pieces in the butternut squash base but upon opening a can, there are no potato or carrot pieces to be found, unlike the cans I've bought from a local grocery store.  I guess this must be a change in Wolfgang Puck's recipe but the photo on the can does not represent the contents anymore.  Several cans out of the twelve pack were delivered dented, although none seriously.  Packing with better filling could have prevented dents in transit."
60199,B000JGENJ4,Dogs didn't care for them,"My dogs didn't care for these too much. They tend to get hard, and become very chewy, and they smell funny, like very artificial. Even my dogs turned their noses up."
166651,B003OB69HU,I love ramen,I got these for my deployed husband. He loves them! I did too. I had about 4 here and there!
5833,B002QWQH0M,Pure pleasure,"Harney & Sons' Dragon Pearl Jasmine tea is one of the cleanest and most delicate of commercially-available teas I've encountered.<br /><br />My first experience with it was at the Williamsburg Lodge, in Virginia, where it was served over the 3 days of an annual convention I attend there.  While a shame to have to sip it standing up or moving between speaker sessions, I had a remarkable sense of being elevated above the rush around me.  The bouquet is evocative and tended to linger in the air yet was in no way overpowering... more like a stroll through a jasmine-studded garden.  Upon tasting, the first impression seems to register near the tip of the tongue, as if sweet, and as the flavor develops in the mouth there is a recognition that it is, in fact, tea but without insistent tannic or other strong overtones.  A fine impression remains when the cup is set down and the intake of breath recharges the sensation.<br /><br />There is no settling of heavy flavors-- a cup is as fine and pleasurable from first sip to last.  I also have found that this tea maintains its character despite the array of waters I have used to make it.  Some brews become distinctly unpleasant when the leaves are introduced to certain mineral-rich well water or treated city water.  The best experience no doubt is when using filtered water, but it is not requisite to enjoying Jasmine Pearl.<br /><br />As a wake-me-up tea on a work morning, I would likely choose a more robust leaf.  However, for a proper moment of relaxation-- or an attempt to induce one in the midst of chaos!-- I hope to never run out of this tea."
50001,B00430B73W,These are yum,Only one bad thing - the are a little large so basically that is almost 300 calories and of couse you cannot eat half because it is so tasty
4665,B000FBM4FI,very nice,"I haven't seen these on the shelf for a while now so decided to buy here, although 12 boxes is a lot. They're great with butter and honey. Haven't tried them with anything else.<br />They're very thin and fragile and so whatever you put on them will stand out.  But they still have a healthy taste."
119446,B0005XO85A,Lies,"Should not be labeled ""Key Lime Juice"" because it doesn't have Key Limes in it.  The actual labeling on the product is correct:  ""Key West Lime Juice"", meaning lime juice from Key West.  But if you are looking for juice that comes from Key Limes, this is not it.  Change the description!"
521265,B000E283KS,The Bestest ever!!,These are the Best-est PopTarts Ever!!<br />Been eating them for 40+ years.<br />I hope they never ever go away.
65065,B002C37TM0,Hated the taste,"This tea has a really bad taste to it, bought it for weight loss, it didn't help. had all the other teas dr oz recommended too. no weight loss, in fact i think i gained weight while drinking teas all through the day as suggested by dr oz. but you have to remember that caffeine makes your pancreas put out more insulin which in turn makes you hungry :("
8761,B003KSWEHG,Strong Green Tea,"This tea is strong and has a smoky flavor - you can feel the leafy greenness though. It's not very bitter. I think it's a bit expensive for it is - but I haven't found a replacement. I guess we're paying for the fancy packaging, which in my opinion is a real waste, especially when you go through 3-4 cups a day like I do. Ahmed's Gunpowder green tea is stronger and is pretty good, but is available for cheaper than Dilmah's in the local Indian stores."
7858,B000ELWDRI,More chicken please!,"The soup itself was excellent -- a nice, well-tasting mix of meat, veggies and wild and white rices, but surely a few more chunks of chicken could have been added. I bought it at local grocer -- two cans for $4."
20066,B000NY8OLU,Professional whipped cream,"If you are preparing a desert with whipping cream, this is the product to use. You will have a professional look and the whipped cream with Whipit added, holds in the refrigerator for about three days. Without, it will turn runny in less than a day."
228001,B003VXHGPK,Our favorite k-cup yet,"We were given a Keurig for a wedding present, along with several variety packs. So far, Wolfgang Puck's Jamaica Me Crazy is our favorite, and we will definitely be repeat buyers of this flavor."
79484,B003TNANSO,Too bland,"I ordered this item, hoping that the combination of nuts would be good, but I was sadly disappointed with the taste.  Its like they tried to use as little sweetener as possible, leaving a dry, dull, bland taste and its like I could have just bought a bag of mixed nuts for cheaper than what I paid for this box of bars.<br /><br />Would not buy again."
7896,B000OP16W2,"Nice tree, but where's the rest?","The tree is nice, but that is the only part besides the pot.  Did NOT come with a matching drip tray, as promised.  Instructions were lacking information and were merely a printed piece of paper."
7195,B004UNSBMM,Why can't I find this locally?,"This is absolutely the best tasting coffee I have ever drank!  I can't find it locally, thankfully Amazon has saved me once again."
5364,B004565GV8,Hydrogenated oils,"On top of the delightful aspartame, this comes complete with hydrogenated oils and is a dead ringer for Country Time Lemonade mix."
39625,B004Q9QIPM,disappointed,Found mold on some of the jerky.  Tossed the whole package in trash.  Disappointed. My family loves jerky and I am trying to find new companies to try.  This was my first purchase of this brand.
351342,B0017OGFU2,dog does not like it,Bought this for my dog that could stand losing some weight. Rescue dog. Only food I have given her that she does not like. Had to buy canned dog food to mix with it. That is the only way she will eat it. Probably will not be buying this type of food again.
342466,B000NMK4O2,Got a disease and died,We don't like these Hawaiian umbrellas. We have had 3 and 2 (including this one) have caught some sticky fungus and died. We will not buy another.
1188,B00283V4GQ,Great for Birthday Themed Party,"I used this for my daughters candy land birthday party and the kids loved them! They aren't full size, but they are still sooooo cute!!!"
514939,B001SITXH4,Soldiers love it,We support a number of soldiers deployed to Afghanistan and several of them request peppered jerky above everything else.
40184,B0012YEKCM,It will be thrown away.  Looks like a weed.,"I must have gotten the scraps.  My tree was about 5 inches tall and crossed only once.  Since adding water, the braids are loose.  It is nothing like the pictures and descriptions.<br />9 Green Box should be ashamed to send out anything like this.<br />I would never had bought it... I would have never accepted it as a gift.  It will probably be in the trash next week.<br />It is a ""Money Tree""  =  I lost money and they make a killing on swindling customers over the internet."
3349,B005K4Q1VI,Tastes like a diet product,"I looked forward to a delicious hot cocoa, but was very disappointed with the flavor. It has an awful aftertaste, like the taste you get after drinking a bad diet soda. Also kind of weak, even on the smallest cup setting."
270663,B0018Q50W8,AWSOME PASTA!,"BEING A DIABETIC THIS PASTA IS HEAVEN. I COULD TASTE NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND REGULAR PASTA. ALSO, NO DIFFERENCE IN TEXTURE-A BIG PLUS.<br />PETE"
10312,B003EML8PM,"So tasty, but has MSG.","It cooks in microwave so fast, and it's really good right after you cook, but unfortunately it has MSG in it. Nonetheless, the fat and sodium content on this is not too bad when compared to regular pork rinds. I uploaded a photo of the nutrition facts so you can see the ingredients too."
4565,B002TMV3E4,"Excellent tasting coffee, naturally decaffeinated","This is the best decaf my family and I have tried in a long time. It's smooth, not bitter and has enough flavor without being too strong like some other brands I've tried. I like that it's decaffeinated using the natural swiss water process instead of chemicals. That's a big plus for me because many brands don't tell you how they decaffeinate their coffee. I usually buy whole bean, but this ground is so nice and fine, and it saves me time having to grind it and get it just right. I'd suggest following the instructions given on the bag for the best taste, seal tightly and store in the refrigerator to keep the flavor. This is one I'll be buying again."
384893,B000F9Z1V4,Completely overpriced,Don't buy these at $37 for 24 boxes! You can get them cheaper at the supermarket! How can they call this a sale price- it's misleading.
463200,B002BTZZ5S,Everything you need is in this kit,This kit has everything you need to make a 5 gallon brew. It is also cheaper than buying it at your local brewing store.
398185,B003Q4TSZA,Kahlua syrup...NOT,This syrup tasted nothing like Kahlua! I have no idea what flavor it is. My biggest mistake was buying a three-pack.
108813,B001FYUVG8,love that these are yogurt flavor!  my dog loves booda bones!,I have no problem w/my dog eating these.  He loves these booda bones. I had never seen the yogurt ones; he loves them.
5313,B004XMIRU6,Expensive...but when you taste it you will know why,"This coffee was delicious! I actually purchased it as a gift, but since I paid $30 for 1 lb of coffee, I tasted the freakin coffee!<br /><br />It was so good! I meant to purchase the light roast, but accidentally ordered the medium. It was full bodied and delicious, totally lacking the high acidity that you find with most commercial coffees. I can't afford 100% pure Kona all the time and normally buy blends, but this coffee is the delicious gourmet coffee you need to buy and keep for company or to treat yourself now and then."
336955,B002IEU6NW,Decaffeinated Tea,Have been buying this product for over two years and buying on line saves me about 25% over the store price
8788,B002P59VSA,very good!,Can't complain. Taste good and had quick delivery! It was my first time trying this tea out. I usually drink the peppermint one but this gave me energy and sustained me throughout the day.
491789,B000AY9SR2,Vegetarian food,"My husband loves these. I'll bread them and bake in the oven, he loves to dip them in homemade ranch dressing or homemade tarter sauce."
43143,B003O7DVRA,Expiration date?,"Actually I'd like to buy this dry milk powder. But I saw one past review saying that the expiration date of this product is Sep. 2012 which means it only has 5 months left. I left this review, because I'd like to ask the owner when is the expiration date for the product we will receive if we order now. Thanks."
1924,B0016PKA1C,"Works, but hard to open...Buy larger version instead of pod","Even with the tips shared on how to open it, it's still pretty difficult to open.  I guess I have weak hands. My husband usually has to open it for me, and even he doesn't do it with ease.  I would recommend getting the larger Prepara herb savor instead of the pod.  It's much easier to open and can hold more.  I could hardly fit any cilantro in the pod (considering that the grocery sells them in such large bunches and I only use half)."
251492,B001E5DZYS,"Great Price, good coffee","For a water process organic decaf, this product rocked, especially when you add price into the equation. Putting in my second order now!"
176731,B00028HN46,This food is not unbalanced.,Sojos foods have been tested for nutritional content and they are all formulated to have a calcium to phosphorus ratio of 1.4:1. You do not need to add calcium or phosphorus.
206518,B001PKTSQQ,Why Not?,We've always given our dogs some sort of extra fiber.  We like that this is organic - we mix it with applesauce and our ALD loves it.
76542,B00032GJMS,Tasty but too much sugar,"I was trying to increase my consumption of coconut products without increasing my intake of sugar.<br />Unfortunately this pina colada mixer has ~ 22 grams of sugar (sorry I don't have it<br />in front of me, but it was way over what I allow in a day), so I won't be buying it<br />again!"
28,B001GVISJM,Great Bargain for the Price,I was so glad Amazon carried these batteries.  I have a hard time finding them elsewhere because they are such a unique size.  I need them for my garage door opener.<br />Great deal for the price.
46131,B001EO5QZK,Doesn't taste like English Breakfast to me.,"I usually drink Twinnings or Bigelow English Breakfast tea in bags, but I'm trying to switch to loose teas and this was my first attempt at English Breakfast.  The dry tea smells like English Breakfast to me, but once it is brewed it smells and tastes totally different, and I don't like the taste at all.  I followed the directions and I have tried different brewing times (2-5min), adding different amounts of milk and/or sugar.  Other people might like it, but be aware that it may not taste anything like what you expect."

51842,B004TEXEYW,Rusted and Badly Dented Cans - All of them.,"Every can had rust spots and bad dents in them(definitely not from the shipping).  This has to be from a factory reject supply.  They were inside of their stamped expiration dates, but that did not evoke confidence.  I generally don't care about this kind of thing, but given the condition, the fact that they are badly damaged and from China, makes me question what if any health codes were passed by this fruit."

26618,B000YSS7EO,Buyer beware,"We used to love this product feeding it to our son twice a day for several months.  About 3 months ago, we opened a can and there was definitely something wrong with it.  The consistency was clumpy instead of the normal light, fluffy flakes.  The color was off as well.  The most notable change was the terrible smell.  I did contact the company and they responded to me right away.  The answer made some sense and it has been quoted by others here in this forum.  My problem now is that it just makes no sense!  How on earth is there no recall or some other investigation of this product by the FDA?  It was very noticeable that it all but disappeared off of store shelves and online stores for a few weeks.  The price here on Amazon has gone way up.  I was still buying it but will no longer.  I was still opening cans that were rancid and others that are not.  It is not cheap so I can't afford to keep playing the guessing game on my dime."

I really wanted Butter Rum and was willing to pay More for<br />that flavor instead of paying a higher price for a secondary flavor.  Unhappy!!!"

I actually emailed Davidson's tea which said I would get a reply in 24 hours. I never heard back from them as to whether the tea had caffeine or not.  So beware if you want Decaf as this is confusing.  I had hoped for a peach tea with a hint of spice, while this is so spicy, you can smell the spice thru the plastic bag in the closed box.  I did use one bag with several regular decaf bags for iced tea and liked that."

5106,B0073FG1H6,Tasty,"I don't eat chips often, but when I do, these are some of my favorites. They have all the flavor and texture of traditional tortilla chips, but it is the subtle lime flavoring that makes them special. The lime flavoring appears to be a seasoning that has been dusted on. Some chips seem to have barely any flavor and I find myself looking for those with the most. Still, none of them have quite enough for my tastes. I wish that these chips had more that just a ""hint"" of lime."

It usually takes them an hour or so to finish chewing so it's a great time passer for them. One negative thing I'd complain is the strong smell of the bag, though. I have to tuck it away in a corner in order not to smell it often when pass by. This might not apply to everyone, since my nose is a bit more sensitive than most normal people. Over all, I'd had given 5 star if it wasn't for the smell, I have to give 4 stars for now."

I can eat habenero and serrano peppers whole, and they do not give me any problems. I will not be ordering these again. If you opened up the can and split them with a friend, it's still enough to cause serious heart burn. It has me questioning if the oil used is rancid or not? Low price sucked me in, but lesson learned."

22209,B000KV61FC,Less than 12 hours to chew up the rope making it useless,My 11 month old Welsh Corgi figured this out the first time she took it from my hand.  However within a matter of hours she had the rope soaking wet and chewed mostly in half.  The rope is now soft and not a useable tool to get the treat out.  The knot was also too big and frayed to let any of the snacks out of the bottle.  You should also know that the snacks this company makes are too big for the extra small bottle.

7139,B004K30HO2,Very Positive Experience,"We have had a Keurig Mini Brewer for over 2 years and the family really likes it!  We all have different tastes and we like the idea of preparing a cup of our choice, without wasting an entire pot.  We enjoy hot chocolate, hot tea, iced tea, and, of course, coffee - but, even then, we like a good cup of ""morning"" coffee, flavored coffee during the day, and decaf at night - so the pot is in use constantly and with a variety of goodies.<br /><br />I was given a gourmet assortment of ground coffee, and it has been sitting on the shelf for quite awhile.  But, now, thanks to the disposable K-cups, I am finally able to experiment with some lovely new flavors, while the ""stuffy die-hards"" in the family can stay with their favorite brew.  As soon as I saw the disposable K-cups and filters I knew I had to order this product. It's easy to use - disposable - and it's just as fast to make a cup of delicious coffee in this container as it is to stand over the two-drawer rack trying to decide which flavor to choose.  We are very happy with this product!"

Those of you espousing a desire to drizzle this stuff on your food might be sorely disappointed to learn that the truffle flavor in those tiny $[...] bottles of ""truffle oil"" are made in a laboratory. There's not a molecule of actual truffle in them. It's a sinful shame that's perpetuated despite being outed a few years ago in an enlightening New York Times article called ""Hocus-Pocus, and a Beaker of Truffles."" Read it and weep: [...].<br /><br />And if you see ""truffle oil"" advertised on the menu somewhere, you might ask if they're using any other artificial flavorings in their dishes..."

Taste is not unlike a typical cherry soda pop.  Expected sugar content (natural).  130 calories.  I'm not likely to make future purchases of this one."
5541,B000MXENCG,holy cheapness!,"I know the price varies for stage 1 foods but sometimes they are a lot cheaper on amazon then in the stores. I wasn't sure how many were in the package so I decided to just buy one.  There are 8 packs of 2 in this package so for the price, you are getting 16 containers.  I personally wasn't sure if I was getting a great price or paying slightly  more then if I went to the supermarket.  I like these gerber containers of baby food.  It's easier to get the food out, they do make some organic varieties, and you seem to get almost double the amount of food for the same price as jars.  If you only use half the lid snaps back on easy like a desposible food container."
28128,B007POT6RM,Not THAT bad!,"I don't know if some of the previous reviews were written about a different product, or what. Granted, this oatmeal does not have the hard lump of brown sugar in the corner of the packet, as I seem to remember from my childhood in the 1970's. But it hardly tastes so bad that I can't eat it. I thought it was fine. Maybe it is not as sweet as it was years ago, but I can't see any ingredient listed on the package that would in any case render the taste as bad as some have said. Add more brown sugar if you want to eat candy... and get over it!"

4483,B001EHDMY4,"Not Too Light, Not Too Sweet, But Oh What A Wonderful Flavor","Every Revolution product I have tried has been a wonderful experience.  Revolution knows how to balance the inherit flavors of tea leaves with other ingredients which make each tea unique and enjoyable.<br /><br />Better Than The Rest<br /><br />I've been buying this particular tea consecutively for the better half of a year now, and I simply love it. No other pomegranate tea comes close to this one in terms of quality and taste.  For example, Trader Joe's store brand (while good) seems as if it has been sweetened (to the point where it's too sweet), and surprisingly the tea turns red after less than a minute of seeping indicating that coloring was added (I didn't check the ingredients, so I may be wrong about this).  There's also Yogi's pomegranate tea which uses a green tea and creates an entirely different taste. I liked it; didn't love it.<br /><br />Complimenting Flavors<br /><br />Pomegranates are often compared to apples.  In fact, pomegranate means ""seeded apple"" (from latin: pomum - apple and granatus - seeded), and like an apple the fruit is sweet and tart, but has a very strong and distinct flavor.  Thus, a light white tea is the perfect companion; it doesn't overpower the pomegranate flavor but allows it to mingle on the tongue.  Likewise, the amount of pomegranate, or rather the intensity of the pomegranate flavor, is truly perfect.  No flavor overpowers the other, but rather all the flavors compliment one another.<br /><br />Brewing<br /><br />I'm sure someone out there will say that I'm butchering tea when I brew this, but when I do, I leave the tea bag in the mug until I've consumed it all.  I find that the taste never gets too strong and never gets bitter.  Typically this is only the case for herbal teas, which don't become overpowered since they contain no tea leaves.  In this case the same is true, perhaps because it is a white tea which is naturally light. The tea itself literally contains dried pomegranate seeds (flesh included).  Do you know that taste you get a few moments after you eat a pomegranate seed? (If you don't, try it! It's wonderful.)  That initial bite from the tartness followed by sweetness you get (or at least I get) from a pomegranate is captured in this tea, and it makes sense! There's pomegranate seeds in there!<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Buy this tea!  I was a little skeptical about my first purchase since I was buying 6 boxes, but it was a great choice that I do not in the least bit regret.  I've bought this for myself and for family, with everyone absolutely loving it. Best $20 I have ever spent (and continue to spend)!"

I'm certainly happy about it because not only is it delicious, but it's also more affordable.  3 boys can consume a box of hot cocoa very quickly, even with limits set.  It's also very convenient to have it shipped automatically.  If we don't drink that much I simply skip a month.  If friends come over and we drink a lot, I just order an extra box.  It's quick, simple and delicious."

But it actually is a big deal if you are a soda junky and want to cut down on the negative effects without losing all the experience.  I hate diet soda because it just doesn't taste right and has way too many synthetic chemicals in it. However, this drink has no sugar, corn syrup, or preservatives. I suppose the CO2 may not be the best for you, but you gotta live a little."

1121,B0028SWACS,Smells like Heaven...,"As soon as I opened the teabag envelope, the smell was truly Divine Nasal Candy :-).  As good as the bag and the lingering scent on the envelope smelled, the tea proved to be rather bitter.  I may have steeped it too long, so will see if the bitterness abates steeping less.  However, as I prefer milk or cream products in flower teas, the bitterness was soon dispelled with a little soy creamer and an enjoyable cup was had.  Lychee is truly a wonderful flavor for tea.  I suspect the flowers added to this lychee tea may contribute to the bitterness in the straight tea.  Will definitely reorder."
440859,B009HXB2JO,good product - shop around though,"Buy this locally if at all possible, the price is way out of line.<br /><br />I just bought the larger size, 1000g, for 3.99 at an Asian Market."
28081,B007POT6RM,Quaker hear our PLEA!!! CHANGE IT BACK!,"This shows an older box but from what I can tell the dates of these reviews and the fact they mention the lower sugar and horrible new taste I assume they are selling the 'Lower Sugar, Heartier Texture, and New Great Taste"" boxes. They changed it all. It is horrible. Please Quaker change it back! You already had a High Fiber MBS and another one that is 50% less sugar MBS and a Weight COntrol MBS----but you HAD to mess with the original?! I have ate this for almost 40 years. Not anymore. I have to go to store brands now. Please change it back. Oh and if you want to join the movement Hehe...go to FBook and join, 'Change quaker maple and brown sugar oatmeal back' or something like that. There are a few groups on Fbk. Also go to the discussion site on the official Quaker Oatmeal Fbook page---there you can add to the disgruntled unhappy customers that Quaker has upset. Many discussions there on this."
8922,B004FZX2YC,It didn't kill my baby,"My baby hasn't died yet.<br /><br />If your baby has food allergies and your doctor prescribes this stuff... and you love your baby, it's certainly worth every penny. As expected, my daughter is still alive and she's doing well."
452618,B000YSTGGW,Good for the system.,"I bought this product because it was organic AND it contained the probiotic elements that my baby needed to help her digestive issues.  She does not eat it by itself, I add it to the home-made purees I make at home."
410,B001IZM8A6,Great product,"I ordered this product at the same time as the Kirkland Signature salmon.  The Raincoast Trading Co. salmon is very tasty, equally as good quality salmon as the Kirkland.  However, the Raincoast arrived in perfect condition, the Kirkland cans were dented badly.  I recommend this product to anyone who likes boneless skinless canned salmon."
7691,B001E5DZTS,Nice Alternative to cows' milk,"My kids enjoy this goat milk product with their cereal and I use it for cooking as well.  Although I haven't tried many goat milk products this one is easy since I make what I need.  Therefore there is little waste.  It is also easy to pack and take when traveling.  Overall, I recommend this product."
44347,B001M1YW0U,"Which is it? ""14oz box, pack of 14"" or ""Pack of seven, 14 ounces each (total of 98 ounces)"" ?","Which is it? ""14oz box, pack of 14"" or ""Pack of seven, 14 ounces each (total of 98 ounces)"" ?  The description on this and the rice chex is contradictory. And I would have believed the 'written' description (it being 7), except that (a) this would be like $7/box which would be crazy expensive and a bit unusual, and (b) people 'referenced' 14, except maybe those reviews were prior to having received the order, it was hard to tell. Feedback?<br /><br />I will edit this with a real review or remove it if I order it. I couldn't find the proper link to ask amazon the question and didn't think using a forum thread would find people who specifically ordered from this page."
344860,B000PEFNHG,Too sweet,"I bought this, tasted a drop, then threw it in the garbage.  If you look on the label, the ingredient list (in tiny print) lists corn syrup as the third ingredient (after water and oil).  If you like your food to taste like candy, this may be just the thing, but otherwise, beware."
538,B000G6RYNE,Gone down hill,"When originally produced in England  these we're the best chips I had ever tasted but unfortunately since they were bought out by the US conglomerate they now taste plain nasty. Hard rather than crispy, are much thinner than they used  to be and lacking any  flavour , a real shame."
550197,B00501N8B2,didn't get what i asked for,"the one i got says ""cleanse"" on the box, I don't know what it means, but I know that I picked the one that doesn't say ""cleanse"" on the box. i'm all the more angry because that one costs way cheaper. and all the more am i angry because i'm not going to bother to go through the refund process. plus it took it ages to arrive"
43382,B004AHBMJW,Very disappointed in Ranger Ribs,These ribs splinter terribly into small sharp pieces.  Took them away from my dog as I don't want to risk an intestinal perforation from these.  Very disappointed in these.  I'll stick to bully sticks from Bravo instead.
51203,B0027UI1QG,Good Flavor,"I like these crackers.  I'm trying to cut grain out of my diet and I do miss the occasional cracker with cheese.  I miss not having a chip to gather up a little dip while watching a movie.  These crackers meet that need.  They are also low carb if you are trying to cut out excess carbohydrates.  Only reason that I didn't give them a 5-star is the shipping costs make them an expensive treat.  If I can find them locally, I will buy them on a regular basis. If I can't, they will be an occasional treat."
5708,B004PEDM7K,all Natural ~!!!!!!!!,Yay an all natural Kids Gum .  NO BHT Preservative ! No dangerous artificial sweetners .  Tastes fine and not bad for you !
39383,B003VKR0J0,LOVE!,"My daughter is 4 months old and has reflux and this is the ONLY formula she can hold down and we've tried almost all of them.  We've even tried adding rice cereal (I know you're not supposed to, but let's be honest...we all do) to other brands, but nope, spit that up too. This formula actually helped her almost immediately.  Within the first day of using it, her spitting up drastically reduced.  It does constipate her, like other reviewers have said, but our ped said we could give her 4oz of apple juice every day to help with it.  We do that, and it helps a little, but we've found that the baby probiotic, baby giaia, works waaaaay better-don't get it on amazon, got to your local pharmacy and get it there.  It's expensive (like $30), but with the formula and the probiotic, my daughter is now an angel!"
32927,B001P05K8Q,"Dog Loves These, but some too thick","My dog loves these treats and begs for them.  The only problem is the irregular thickness of these treats.  Some are 3 times as thick as others.  When my dog eats the thick ones, she ultimately throws them up.  I continue to buy them because she loves them, but I hate throwing out the thick ones as expensive as these are per treat.  I wish they had better quality control."
7484,B000143ZK2,Grandpa Po's Originals are deliciously addicting,"These are a great grab and go snack that satisfy.  I love pop corn but don't eat it that much because my husband hates my breath while I am eating it at the movies, so I take Grandpa Po's Originals instead and he keeps hogging the bag!  I know soy beans are healthy for you and this is the only way I enjoy to eat them.  I love these!!!"
60172,B000EDG598,Not 100% safe for SCD/GAPS!,"BRM 'gluten free' items still contain some sort of gluten cross contamination.  We started SCD/GAPS to deal with lingering health problems caused by eating a regular GF diet for our Celiacs.  I bought 2 different brands of almond flour, one made specifically for and by SCD and BRM.  We used up the other brand and started using the BRM and guess what?  ALL symptoms of Celiac started coming back!!  Doing an Internet search I did find out that many Celiac's not only react badly to BRM almond flour, but to many other of BRM GF items too.  Before SCD, we had stopped using any BRM GF baking products because we always got 'gluten sick ' from them.  We will NEVER use another  GF flour from BRM again because their food safety is just not strict enough.  I did get a prompt refund from BRM for the $125 I spent on the 25lb box of almond flour though."
7726,B001E5DZTS,Great item!!,Works well instead of formula or soy milk for my daughters bottle. Easy to mix as long as water is warmed. And she loves the taste! Plus much more affordable than buying goat milk cartons in the store.
5532,B002Y7520K,Awesome flavoring,I used this in making a wedding cake for some friends.  It tasted awesome mixed into the fodant!  I would purchase other flavorings from this vendor.
538157,B004H8ERLE,unclogs sinuses,I find this product yummy.  The ginger plus the caffeine helps my sinuses unclog.  I also like the Spicy Apple Ginger chew for uncloging my sinuses.
5259,B0012YEKCW,Cats love this stuff!,"Unfortunately, bunnies love it, too, so we are having to grow this batch of cat grass indoors.  The cats love this stuff:  just put it where they can reach it and they will ""go to town"" on it, munching it all up.  It does not make them behave erratically, like catnip does, so don't worry about that.  You don't have to do anything to these seeds other than press them into some moist soil and water when the soil starts to become dry and crumbly.  That's it!  A nutritious treat for your cats!"
423990,B002E0S506,Fruit pouches,My daughter is 10 and she doesn't eat apples except for in this form! She has one for snack every day!
490283,B001HTL7VY,Not what it said,It says a pack of 12.  I received 6 and have never heard from them again.  I contacted them and have heard nothing.
10186,B003EML8PM,WASTE OF MONEY,"I received my shipment today, and tried to microwave four bags using different time settings. Only one or two out of each bag microwave correctly. I even put the unpopped on a plate as someone suggested and nothing. I carefully followed directions for each bag. If I could rate this, a zero I would."
383041,B001PMDYV4,No Savings,I ordered the cat food online because of the savings and convenience but will not order again because there were 3 damaged cans. It ended up being more expensive than buying in the store.
11038,B001NJI7GQ,well ...,"This stuff is pretty disgusting.  I don't care if Madonna, Tom Cruise or whatever celebrity invested in the company and carries a container of it around for photo opps, it tastes bad.  And as far as rehydrating better than water, umm, don't think so.  It might replenish potassium, although, unless you are participating in the Olympics, you probably are not going to risk a potassium deficiency from physical activity."
36532,B004CLCEDE,Miracle Noodle? Not quite but not bad...,"Definitely is as slimy as people say. You definitely need to wash it off thoroughly to get that stink of fish off. After a solid wash, they're a little gushy but solid with a bunch of pasta sauce."
80246,B004342XH2,Not the flavor I was expecting for Hot Cocoa,The Taste of this Chocolate almost made me pack up my Keurig and take it Back to the store! I purchased this Hot Cocoa out of excitement when I brought my Mr. Coffee Keurig on sale for Black Friday.  I am an avid hot cocoa drinker and this by far is the worst tasting chocolate in my opinion. It was watery and had an awful artificial sweetener aftertaste. Granted the first time I did not shake the K-cup as directed so I gave it a second try after shaking. Surprisingly it didn't do a d@mn thing to help the taste! On the bright side if you long for a watered down artificial sweetener as an after taste in a drink then this is the K-cup for you.
560951,B000LKZ5XQ,worst cookies ever,a friend bought be these cookies to cheer me up one day. I had to spit them out! they are yucky!!!!!!!!!!!!!
77227,B002YZXRT0,where's the bubbles?,"i love this sparkling water and usually have had it in the glass bottles...  but hard to find, so when i saw it was available in the plastic bottles i figured i would try it....  i was very disappointed...  half the bottles had no fizz left when they were opened...  virtually flat!.... the ones that were still carbonated were good but the others were not drinkable...  i would not order this product again...."
1963,B001FQ0UEE,Yum,I used to buy these at World Market however they discontinued them :(<br />So I am forced to buy them online!  The rose and violet flavors are good however I did not like the anise flavor because they were too strong and licorice tasting for me.<br /><br />I carry these in my purse to freshen my breath and they are really good.<br />Also the tin is very cute.
57475,B000LKYPGY,DON'T BOTHER,basically glop rolled in sesame seeds - very poor texture - not fun to try to eat

Even when chewing two pieces at the same time, the flavor does not last more than 5 minutes. This is another example of an expensive Xylitol product that is not worth buying. I do not recommend this one."
155026,B0067OTDHO,my cats wouldn't eat it...,My cats absolutely would not eat this food so it was a waste of money..it is just sitting in our cabinets.  I will donate it to a shelter...
21968,B000KV61FC,Don't waste your money,"I bought this for my 20lb puppy on the advice of my trainer.  What a disaster!  Not only was I bruised from her swinging it around trying to get the treats out, but so were my walls and furniture.  Within a week the plastic jug broke and that was the end of it."
64152,B001E6EJX8,Hydrogenated Palm Oil in this Diet bar,"Well, these taste ok, but there's partially hydrogenated oil in these bars-- really? Ugh.<br />Ingredients include:<br />Coating (Sugar, Partially Hydrogenated Palm Kernel Oil, Cocoa Processed With Alkali, Whey, Nonfat Dry Milk, Soy Lecithin, Sorbitan Monostearate, Salt, Polysorbate 60, Artificial Flavor),"
25922,B0042RNHVG,Stale,"I've purchased the Golden Malted Natural Pancake and Waffle flour in the past and was excited to see the Blueberry on Amazon.  I received the mixes yesterday and am very disappointed. It  has little flavor and waffles are not as light as the regular mix, possibly due to the expiration date being 2 weeks from today."
8409,B003VXFK44,Perfect every day coffee.,"I have tried many different k-cups and this has remained my favorite for the longest time. It is the perfect balance, not too weak and not too bold. And since I usually drink my coffee black, the flavor alone is very important to me. It' has a great flavor and not too acidic."
29582,B000PDY3P0,Product has changed and now tastes just like microwave popcorn,"I tried this product about 2 years ago and it was just like movie theatre popcorn at that time but since that time, they must have changed the product and now tastes more like a microwave popcorn that lacks flavor.  The packaging has changed to include a separate salt/butter flavor compartment and the oil is now a liquid instead of a solid. Very disappointed in this product and sadly I now have 23 packets remaining."
5773,B003TIVBSU,beans,"well packaged, and alot of beans for the price(50+).  using them to make home made vanilla extract.  wounderfull flavor. will buy again."

2486,B0027IQC5K,"Healthy Alternative to Kibble, Canned or Raw Diets","Actually, Sojo's strongly recommends that the meat you add to their mixes be raw, but it an be cooked as I choose to do.  My dog arrived with coccidia and giardia as a puppy.  Through veterinary mismanagement, he was never completely healthy for the first 2 1/2 years of his life.  After watching him get sicker on an aggressive course of antibiotics and prednisone for his Inflammatory Bowel Disease, I took him to a holistic veterinarian.  Part of his treatment has been a homemade diet of Sojo's and meat plus no medications.  I'm extremely pleased to report he has had no GI episodes in over 6 months and has reached a point where I consider him healthy.  His coat is glossy and much fluffier than before he's finally at a good weight.  I have before and after photos that show a dramatic improvement,much of which I credit to Sojo's.<br /><br />It does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble, but I make 4 days worth at a time. This takes me about 30 - 40 minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after.  To be completely honest, I'm not thrilled about cooking for my dog but I am thrilled with the results.  If I was able to feed him raw (perhaps down the road, when our vet gives the ok), preparation time would  be almost nothing."
6642,B001LG945O,"Too sweet, too expensive, too much packaging","Yeah it's gluten free and whatever, but unless that's a really big issue for you and you're having trouble finding sugary drinks to enjoy on your gluten-free diet, there's no real draw to this drink over say, orange fanta or any number of other carbonated juice type drinks. I thought it was massively overly sweet, and I have something of a sweet tooth. The orange flavor wasn't particularly authentic or delicious, and it left a sour aftertaste. I got a free sample this time, and I cannot see actually paying money to buy this product again. On an environmental note, packaging and shipping these things in tiny little cans makes for more waste, and I don't appreciate that either. Not a fan."
357893,B001GCTTRQ,great product,I bought this for treating symptoms of menopause.  It has been a life saver.  thank you
849,B0041CKRJC,Aluminum Free!,"This baking soda works great for cooking or for health reasons.  I take it for acid indigestion and heart burn.  Just a 1 tsp in a half glass of water and it's gone.  I use it to make my body more alkaline, so it's great for changing your pH level in your body!"
28401,B007OXJMD2,Weak,"The coffee has a decent hazelnut flavor but is very weak.  Its not too bad if you brew it using the small or medium size, but very watered down as a large size.  We switched to a new brand called San Francisco Bay French Roast Decaf."
71450,B004F1LNDI,No stomach upset with these!,"If you're looking for a product while on the bike for fueling and have had stomach issues digesting those nasty gels, this is the product to get.  It works quite well, has no crash, and no stomach upset issues that the gels cause some people.  I love the product, the packaging is a little tricky to open while riding but you'll get the hang of it, and add these as a supplement for long distance rides.  I use these, peanut butter cracker sandwiches, and thin tortillas with PB&J inside."
414680,B001BM3G2U,cornmeal,no problem with the delivery and quality of the product.<br /><br />i'm reordering as soon as it's almost done.
529409,B001FB6BU6,Good fish sauce,purchased this item through amazon. delivery was timely and well packaged. item was just as advertised. works well in all dishes that call for fish sauce. a 24 ounce bottle is a lot of fish sauce so we have plenty to use since it comes in a pack of two!
81276,B0030VBSBG,My daughter loves these,My 11 month old loves these melts - she's been eating them since she was about 7 months old.  The only problem - not really a problem just an observation - is that once her fingers get wet the melts tend to stick to them and she has some difficulty getting them from her fingers to her mouth - she generally ends up with several stuck to her head and behind her ears (not unlike the rest of her food I suppose).  She also likes the berry flavors - I think they're pretty tasty too but all the other adults who've taste-tested found them foul.  Oh well.
62750,B000I1OLT2,Does anyone else on Amazon know what green tea is supposed to taste like?,"Im not sure what everyone else on here thinks green tea is supposed to taste like, but this is not it. I go through about half a gallon of green tea a day, so Im always willing to try new flavors, brands, etc. This is the only one that I have had to literally choke down. This tea is bitter, but thats not the real reason its so bad. The taste is cheap, overpowering, and unpleasant.<br /><br />I think either Stash has its employees writing reviews, or amazonians are being suckered in by the snazzy/hip box and packets of this truly awful tea."
51972,B001CPUPMA,Treat caused ulcers in my dog's GI tract,"I should have known when I touched these strips.<br />They are rock solid hard.<br />Anyways I gave it to my dog for the first time, and it caused minor tearing and ulcers in her GI tract. I first noticed little blood in her stool, and dog was visibly unwell.<br />I brought her to the vet immediately before they closed for the day, and did xrays, stool test, and all that.<br />Ended up with a $1600 vet bill, but at least a recovering dog that shouldn't have any long term health problems.<br />The treat basically was so hard the sharp edges was causing minor tearing the GI tract. My dog is a chewer too and she never swallows anything whole, and I was watching her as she ate.<br />I had given her bully sticks, raw hide before (about once or twice a week), and she had no problems.<br />It couldn't have been anything else either because she hasn't eaten anything else other than her dog food (Ziwipeak) in the past 3 days. Ziwipeak isn't a kibble diet either. It is jerky like meat which is very soft. No signs of anything else (like plastic or metal toys, etc) on her x-ray either. So yes, it is these Chickenstrips.<br /><br />Anyhow, I took a new one out of the packaging, and attempted to cut it with a pair of scissors.<br />The strip was so hard my scissors wouldn't cut through, especially where the vein/tendon/muscle fiber (or whatever that is) is.<br />I probably will need a penknife or a small saw to do the job.<br /><br />So yea I learned my lesson, and should have listened to what another reviewer said earlier.<br />I took my chances because this product had so many 5 star feedback, and I made my dog go through unnecessary and avoidable pains and hardship. And also landed myself with a $1600 vet bill (sigh...)<br /><br />Definitely wouldn't advice this to anyone. If you have a really big dog like a Mastiff or a Pit Bull, I can see how this is probably OK because the dog itself is big, so this treat is really small compared in size. I have a 10 pound dog, so yea. I still wouldn't recommend anyone risking any chances, well unless you think a few thousand dollars in vet bills is nothing and don't mind your dog going through all that pain.<br />From now on if I am giving any chicken treats, its gonna be freezed dried or I will just boil or steam some boneless chicken myself.<br />Lesson learned. An expensive, painful, and totally avoidable one.<br /><br />I am so regretful for what I have done to my dog -_-"

60642,B003QNJYXM,Having the jitters is not being energetic,I was curious and tried this item on Jan 28th.  I bought 2 bottles of the lemon-lime.  The taste is very bad---need to flush it down with a glass of water.  Within about 30 minutes I began feeling very uneasy---sort of had the jitters----didn't have a lot of energy but was very nervous and just could not sit down.  I was afraid it was effecting my heart rate or blood pressure but I checked and both those remained normal even though I felt very uneasy.<br />I tried it a day later with the second bottle---same results.  Very uncomfortable feeling---I will not use it anymore
72506,B003ZXAN4C,Chocolate all melted,The freshness wasn't a problem with this order...however there was a problem.  The chocolate on the Fudge Stripes was all melted off of the cookies and was stuck to the inside of the package.  Another no go for repeat sales.
46074,B001EO5QZK,weak Earl Grey,"This tea is a disappointment because its flavours are weak.  It takes about double the amount suggested to brew a proper pot.  The packaging is green, but that does not make up for the weak tea inside.  If you do not like a strong, traditional bergamot flavour, then try this one.  You might like it, but I did not."

18651,B00008JOL0,"After a month, I am a believer","I purchased both the beef and chicken flavor Hip Action about a month ago and was very skeptical for a couple of reasons. First, my dog has not liked any other Glucosomine treats I've given him in the past. The pills were difficult to get in him as well. I was also skeptical I would see any difference. My dog is a 12 year old Husky-Great Pyrenese mix and weighs about 100 pounds. He has extreme arthritis is all four legs and it is increasingly difficult for him to go up and down our stairs. After giving him 4 of these treats per day for a little over a month now, we are seeing a difference. I am so surprised! He seems to feel better and though the steps are still a challenge, he is getting up them in one try now instead of three of four tries. And, most importantly, he loves these treats! Thank you! Knowing our time left with this most important member of our family is getting shorter, I am so relieved I can make him a little more comfortable in the last stages of his life."

They are slow to spout, the roots are rotting quicker than the growth. So I'm not getting a tall grass to juice with plus I have to watch the mold. Also I thought all seeds would be equal, but even the taste seems different and my stomach has to have smaller amounts of juice. My biggest regret is purchased 20lbs because I juice ALOT, and regret buying from this vender.<br /><br />I hope other buyers have better succes. Mine was just not so good."

372963,B0002DJ34Y,Its a joke,"What the hell, my two cats looked at it and then looked at me as if what have I given them!! They don't play with it at all. Moreover it was only 3$ in walmart."
45899,B0041NYV8E,A rare review for me,"I seldom give a one star review, usually trying to find something positive about any product, but with this one, I found it lousy.  As a ginger fan, I was eager to receive the packet and conduct a side by side tasting with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SWB73C"">Instant Ginger Honey Crystals Pack of 30 Bags - 18 g Sachets</a> and asked a friend from Jamaica to join me.  First of all, this product is tiny granules that are much darker than the Prince of Peace product.  When mixed with hot water, rather than being a lovely gold, it is a brown.  The first taste was awful and I mean really awful.  My friend added some sweetener to hers thinking it would be an improvement, but it was an unsuccessful attempt.  I felt the lemon flavor overwhelmed the ginger flavor, yet there was some heat from the ginger that tried to come forward.  The flavor was extremely unbalanced and tasted more like the taste of a lemon which has been cut and stored in the refrigerator, turning brown and developing a rancid flavor that creeps into the nose.  My friend held her nose and drank her half cup but I could not force mine down.  Instead, I gladly drank the other beverage."
36632,B004CLCEDE,Stick to Modern Medicine,"These noodles did not cure my cataracts, nor did they clear up my cousin Ned's mysterious rash he got while visiting the Philippines. I cooked two of the six packages up and tried to feed them to the gimp rooster and the mangy-lookin' goose, but they just rooted around looking for the dried peas like in the noodle cups. Next day, yep: rooster still walkin' cockeyed and goose still looking like a beat up dirty pillow at the dump. I'd say these ""miracle"" noodles are no different than snake oil and a gypsy fortune. Miracle angel hair...hmph...my left toe! But they taste alright with soy sauce!"
5686,B000SATIG4,"Okay tea, great for the price though","Tastes like darjeeling, although, like one of the previous reviewers said, it's missing some of the body of a good darjeeling. I give it 3 stars for taste alone. But for the price I paid for it, I guess it's still a solid deal<br /><br />You get what you pay for and for the cost of this tea, I guess it's good. :)"
124755,B0045X7H9A,Did not work,Did not work. Did not give me any extra energy. Taste was alright and that is why I gave the one star.
312678,B0001R04LM,but just one problem!!!!,"Being English living in England and trying this item on a whim, while I am enjoying all the box has to offer I find I really really love the Necco wafer candies, wrong continent, wrong generation, will be walking the floor when all mine have gone and no doubt be ordering again for Christmas."
3000,B0009JI7O8,boring boring boring,"Reading in earlier reviews that these were genuine chinese fortunes, I served them with a chinese Christmas dinner and was greatly disappointed, as were my guests.  Three sample fortunes are:  ""Life is not a struggle.  It's a wiggle.""  ""Management is doing things right: leadership is doing the right things.""  ""If you're feeling down, try throwing yourself into your work.""  These are not fortunes, they are self-help mini-bites.  A fortune is:  ""Your love of travel will soon be satisfied,"" and it doesn't matter if they are predictive or not.  What matters is that they state a fortune.  ""Beware the dog in the corner house,"" would be fun to get.  ""Life is a wiggle"" is boring.<br />The cookies arrived on schedule, as promised, and in good condition in their individual wrappers.  All of that was as I'd hoped.  But content counts, in fortune cookies especially."
6132,B000634M5U,Perfect Nutrition,This product is perfect for my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppy. His stools are very regular and healthy. My Vet was very pleased to know I picked this product instead of a regular store brand. It's all natural and my puppy loves it. :)
83902,B001E0XTRG,Very fresh tea,The quality of this tea is 5 star-it is in sealed bags. We're trying it out to see if helps our nails & skin.
6833,B001LG945O,Too Sweet,"I've tried other flavors of Switch carbonated juice drinks and have enjoyed them. However, this particular flavor of orange tangerine was way too sweet. I felt like I was drinking some sort of carbonated orange ade drink and could barely get it down. While I would probably purchase the other flavors of Switch, I definitely would not purchase this one."
80682,B001KU2TZI,One twin pack not 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Sold by J. Russo,"From reading the title of the product I was under the impression it was 2 twin packs,<br />meaning 4 jars. It is not which makes this a horrible buy at $25.  I have no issue with JIF it is a great peanut butter."
10988,B001BIXK7K,Da Bomb The Final Answer,"I bought this sauce with very high expectations for heat. I was disappointed. I know something is wrong, this is supposed to be very very spicy, but when I tried it... it wasn't too bad at all. I got a bad batch or something. The taste is pretty bad, it's really earthy... dirt flavor. But I wasn't expecting good taste, just heat, which didn't deliver very well. I kept this at a high rating because it's really spicy, but I just got a bad batch."
36374,B001M2BLVM,Out Dated,The shipping was fast but the quality of the chocolate was horrible.  Both boxes had been exposed to the heat ( on one end of each box) at some time prior shipping. . When I checked the Expiration date on the box they each expired within a week of delivery.<br />I use severeal bars of Ghirardelli dipping chocolate a year and expect to have good quality bars delivered( especially at the price they are now).<br />Sorry to have to write a negative review but at this price and the poor condition of the chocolate I feel a closer look at this product on the shipping end is needed.
5929,B001O2IX8E,My Babies Liked This One Right Away,"I tested this one on my twin 10-month old babies and they liked it immediately.  It was their first beef and their first spinach.  I had already given them chicken and they really like it so they are not vegetarians yet anyway.  Mostly I wanted this product for the spinach and the higher iron content.  Somehow they made this particular flavor brand tasty for babies.<br /><br />I like getting these by the case rather than buying them a jar at a time at the store since 2 babies eat so much.  It's good to keep several flavor brands around too I think, to give your baby a variety.  I'm sure I'll get another case when this one is finished.<br /><br />Ingredients per the label: Water, Organic Carrots, Organic Finely Ground Beef, Organic Spinach, Organic Garbanzo Bean Flour, Organic Tomato Paste, Organic Whole Durum Wheat Flour. CONTAINS: WHEAT.<br /><br />This has 110 calories, 31% protein, 100% vitamin A, 8% vitamin C, 4% calcium and 4% iron.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult."
5699,B00434J6YK,"Delicious, but messy.","First of all, these things are delicious. However, opening them without making a mess is nearly impossible. They're super crumbly, so open the package with care. I won't buy them again. There are too many other good options that are way less messy."
177756,B002GDH5Y8,Khrys,"I had heard wonderful things about these noodles, and with the low-cal ""included,"" thought I'd give them a shot.  They were AWFUL!  I rinsed them several times, but they still had a fishy smell.  They also did NOT absorb the flavor of the sauce I cooked them in, as I had read they would do.  Ate about 3 forkfuls, then threw the rest in the trash."

5603,B000G1X45G,"""Good to the last drop!""","This particular type of Yuban coffee is a mild, flavorful coffee that can be enjoyed in the morning or anytime.  It's the coffee my mother seems to prefer over all others.  Not always available in stores, I was thrilled when I found it for sale by Amazon!"
5886,B003KLSZGW,Great healthy snack,"Have tried many crackers, including some other Dr. Kracker, and think this tastes the BEST.  It's hard/crunchy with lots of seeds on it, so if that's an issue, it might not be for everyone.  Buying it in Amazon's 6-pack makes it less expensive than purchasing in the store."
2647,B0016FY6H6,"Of al the Stash iced teas this is the best, and it is still not all that good","What can i say, I love iced tea. I drink a lot of it, and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets. I am also a big fan of Stash products, or rather of all the other stash products I have tried.<br />I purchased a case of all 4 varieties,  (when i say i drink iced tea, i am not kidding) and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my 16 ounces water bottle.<br />I finally found that i needed to dissolve 2 packets in a small bit of hot water first (if not the tea clumped on me), and than add the rest of the water just to make these palatable. And only than were these passable...<br />Over all I am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market."
7864,B001GSOIY4,Kinetic Kraziness!,"This coffee (er, koffee) is superb!  I am lucky enough to live where this is roasted.  I can get my Kinetic fix at the local grocery stores.  You can taste the care put into this flavorful espresso.  Living in a small town, I happen to know the roasters.  You would be hard pressed to find better people.  They are active participants of the ""Great Arcata to Ferndale World Championship Cross-Country Kinetic Sculpture"" race.  If you haven't heard of it, look it up.  We are a strange people, here in Arcata."
9306,B006N3IG4K,Strong Dark Roast Coffee,"This is about the strongest K cup I've purchased.  I like my coffee strong, and before buying a K cup coffee maker, always purchased French roast whole bean and brewed strong coffee.  Brewing this in a K cup machine at an 8 ounce cup will definately provide you with a strong cup of coffee.  Since I brew a cup for my wife and I at the same time, I run two 8 ounce cups with one of these K cups into a small decanter, and then pour into two coffee cups, which still yields a strong flavor, but not enough pop your eyeballs out...<br /><br />Of course, brewing two cups with one K cup drops the price down in half, which at less than thirty cents a cup is on the cheap end of K cup brewing.  I find most K cups are good for up to a 12 ounce cup, and 16 ounces would weaken them too much...  But this works for my wife and I since I have been fixing a cup for each of us for years, and brewing two cups with one K cup is economical."
128606,B0026A2BS6,All Natural Green Tea Powder Matcha Japan 8.8 OZ,The pakage wasn't hte one displayed. It doesn't have any info that is from Japan. The taste is not the one I use the tea bag that is from Japan and I get it from Costco.
125540,B000G7V3R6,If you like the bread....you'll love these!,These pretzle sticks are fantastic. They have a very deep robust pumpernickle flavor and color with just a hint of onion. Make an inside-out ham sandwich by wrapping a thin slice of baked ham and a slice of swiss cheese around one of the sticks.
50343,B0039CHOJ6,empty shells,"These are tasty, very salty.  For the price, it's disappointing that so many shells are empty.  We expected to find shelled pistachios at the bottom of the bag, assuming they fell out of the shells in the package, but there weren't.  We won't buy this product again."
384082,B000LRH6L8,Tasteless,"This jam tastes as if it was made of anything but roses.  No aroma at all.<br />By the time you pay for the shipping, may as well buy something else in the local grocery store."

7521,B000OIWY8Y,SF Tea Lover,"I completely agree w/Grace Brunelle's comments. This the perfect dessert tea. I have given up sugar, but love coconut, and this is the perfect replacement. The smell in the bag is intoxicating, but it mellows to a soft vanilla/almond/coconut smooth sweetness when brewed. I have many excellent teas in my collection, but this beats many of them, especially if you are craving something sweet. Thank you Lana, please keep making (and quickly shipping) this fantastic tea!"
33596,B000LLM9GQ,No fish here,"Horrible stuff, does not smell fishy, smells rotten, taste like metal, mushy, just bad expensive tuna. Can not get pass the smell. Rotten."
2970,B003U97K4M,Great for snacking,"Great for sushi, or for use with Korean kim-bob, or maybe just as a snack. Lightly salted, great crunch, and will support, rice, beef, pork, even fish.<br />Or a vegetable or two."
397756,B001EYUE5M,Morning coffee,I use this as my morning coffee wake up call.  I continue to re-order it because I like the medium roast flavor.
40555,B00020HHRW,A must have if you have painful heavy periods,"I had very painful cramps with Very Heavy bleeding that lasted for 5 days! and this cycle repeated every 21 days! So I would have a full period twice a month!! I was miserable and had to schedule my life around my cycle, because I was doubled over in pain or afraid of the embarrasment of bleeding onto my clothes! A friend recomended drinking this tea and my life changed!! I no longer have ANY Cramps!! the bleeding has subsided to 3 days with a normal flow and now my cycle is regulated to every 26 days or once a month. I have more energy and vitality and dont have to call in sick anymore!! This tea is blessing not only for pregnancy but for your menstrual cycle as well!! I tell every woman I know about this tea!! No need for birth control pills or other hormonal intervention. I love its pleasant light taste and enjoy drinking a cup a day."
6943,B001LG945O,Good but nothing special,"I think I liked a similar drink but this one is just there. It's bubbly. It's sort of orange flavored. It has a sharpness but there's nothing about it that excites me. It's a good old fashioned carbonated beverage and if it's inexpensive buy it. If it's significantly more expensive than most drinks, leave it. Buy coke instead."
8342,B003VXFK44,Tastes like i didn't change the kcup from the last cup,"Honestly the first time I tried Jamaica me crazy I had to double check to make sure that I didn't leave the pod irom my last cup n the coffee maker. Weak coffee, flavor didn't appeal to me either. Might appeal to someone who likes their coffee on the weaker side. Wolfgang's vienna roast was pleasant though."
60129,B001E5E056,"terrible, no flavor","i don't know what the other reviewers are talking about, this cereal tastes like paper.  it's so bad that it's compelled me to look for every review on this product so i can post my opinion.  sorry kashi."
3199,B001YJ6M7Q,Devine  White clam sauce?,"This is the mother load of canned clams. Not just a can of juice with a few floaters, but cups and cups of chopped clams. I found no sand residuals,and I was able to use every last drop of juices.Simply devine recipe on the can, best white clam sauce I've ever made..."
6442,B000QB0WUG,Yummy,Tried this in a turkey burger and it was sooo good. I definitely recommend faery free. Salt can be added or better yet add a sprinkle of Goya Adobo.
39117,B0046ANN2C,Great for bad knees!,My little toy poodle takes a 1/2 of one every day.  They really help with her bad knees.  Hopefully they will work for a long time.  Otherwise she will have to take prescription medication or have surgery.
6802,B001LG945O,light and refreshing,"Overall, this is a nice, light, refreshing drink. The sweetness is a bit sweeter than Juice Squeeze, but not as sweet as Hansen's soda. I tried two flavors: this orange tangerine, and the strawberry watermelon. I preferred this orange one. The flavor was ""cleaner."" But, there are so many different juices in both those drinks, it kindof gets ""muddied."" I think I prefer Juice Squeeze because the flavor seems true-er. My 10-year-old daughter prefers Hansen's, because it is a bit sweeter. But, like I said, overall, this is a very nice drink. No corn syrup. Yea!"
2102,B000EPP56U,Great for you,I would recomend this product for it's fine qualities and taste really good. Very nice and crisp for any snack or with meals when you want to help on the lowering of carbohydrate intake.
25337,B0018CLGNY,The Cats Gave This Two Thumbs Down,"It was time to order cat food again and I thought I'd give the Natural Balance line a try.  My cat loves fish, so I figured that the Tuna and Shrimp Recipe would be a big hit.  Nope.  Both cats in our house gave it two thumbs down votes - neither of them would touch it.  What finicky little critters they can be sometimes [sigh]."
6862,B001LG945O,Nothing special,As the title of my review indicates this product is nothing special in terms of taste. Granted it is missing some of the soda pop bad guys (high fructose syrup and coloring)but the taste is mediocre. This is not something you are going to rave about because of the taste. If you are a health food junkie you might overlook the bland middle of the road taste. Contrary to some reviews I did not find the drink exceptionally sweet but than again everyone has different taste buds. I am not a soda pop drinker so that might have some influence on my less than enthusiastic endorsement. I was switched off. Will this make you give up your favorite soda pop? Probably not. I like the idea of homemade soda water infused juice for that perky fizzing drink better than Switch. Not such a great product in my opinion.
7567,B0014J9OTE,"great gum, will buy more","A bit pricy, but well worth it to avoid the garbage found in other gums.  Made in USA and delicious."
52179,B002OK2FCA,good,"Same quality as Swanson's brand.  Both are great products and taste the same.  I sometimes buy raw organic sunflower seeds and roast them myself, then grind them into butter.  Organic sunflower butter is twice as expensive as organic peanut butter.  But, that's to be expected, or is it?  Sunflower seeds are as common as peanuts, so why is the cost twice as much?"
115,B0037LW78C,Tea review,"I love, love this green tea.  It is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and I usually don't get as many boxes as I did with this merchant.  I will definitely order from this seller again!! Thanks!!  I depend on my green tea fix everyday!"
308110,B001AWBROK,Really tasty!,My daughter loves this food! I tried it and its good!Added bonus is the DHA.
69722,B003CK7O36,Chai means Tea,"Introduced to Stash double Spice Chai in a gift box - we couldn't find it at our local stores. Fab fab fab! The spices are for the nose and the black tea base is stimulating, try it with soy milk for a very nice chai experiance. Close your eyes and your in India."
521928,B0002NYNYO,Not for me,I've bought 1 ounce bottle and I didn't like the taste at all. It doesn't have that truffle aroma and flavor. It tasted like olive oil.
80811,B003DMXDGA,No good.,"Pros: Low Cal. Cons: Hardly any flavor. Seriously, I taste nothing but ""puff"". They get stale fast, and the bag always tears when opening. Always! Very annoying. Sorry, if you want cheddar flavor, look elsewhere. These remind me of rice crackers."
67642,B007OXJK3Y,Attention Chocolate Connoisseurs: Avoid Like The Plague!,"I should start off by saying that I have never understood the appeal of artificial chocolate flavoring.  Even when I was a kid and a total junk food junkie, the things that were artificially flavored chocolate always tasted strange.<br /><br />Fast forward to my life as an adult and I find that neither has the technology behind artificial chocolate flavoring improved, nor my opinion of it. It still has a subtle (and sometimes, not-so-subtle) metallic taste and an obvious artificial one. So do many artificial flavorings, but most seem to replicate the real thing about 75-80% of the time. Not so with artificial chocolate.<br /><br />So then, it will come as no surprise that this K-Cup variety is equally disappointing. Imagine the most mass-produced chocolate doughnut with a laundry list of ingredients (and unpronounceable ones at that) and one pretty much has the taste of this coffee flavor---at best.  It's not the worst chocolate flavored coffee I have ever had, but when most are pretty bad, that's not saying much.<br /><br />For the life of me, I can't understand the reviews of other incarnations of this product which claim that it's ""like licking the frosting off a chocolate donut"" or ""tastes like adding chocolate syrup to your coffee"". No, and no!  It's also a far cry from ""cafe mocha"", as well.  Come to my house and I will make you a K-Cup of coffee with real chocolate and you can have a far superior cafe mocha experience.<br /><br />It tastes little like a doughnut, a chocolate doughnut, and nothing like chocolate doughnut glaze and marginally like chocolate at all.  If you are a fan of products from companies like Ghirardelli or Lindt, I will guarantee that you will be disappointed at best and disgusted at worst.<br /><br />I received this flavor as part of a sampler from the manufacturer's [GMCR] mail order program, and fortunately only received one K-Cup, as I would never place a full order for this flavor.  I kept hoping it would get better, but such was not the case. It was all I could do to finish the cup of coffee and not throw it out."
376304,B000MXHQS4,Food Allergies can happen at any time...,"After eating 5 1/2 of the 8 packs, my little guy developed an allergy to peas!  Nothing major, but ever time he eats peas now his face breaks out in a rash.  I thought children were allergic or not, but this isn't the case..."

73645,B000EPOC2S,OK,These cookies are hard & somewhat<br />lacking in taste. We threw out half the bag.<br />Mostly because my children did not like<br />ginger snaps & my husband and I did not care for these.
158220,B000VKA92I,Great stuff that's easy to use,"We tried pills, but our dog didn't like them. We tried this liquid and he loves the taste and it eases his joints after playing ball."
33824,B001EQ5CSE,disappointed,I ordered this Mocha Java because the Green Mountain brand was not available.  There is no comparison.  I am very disappointed in the flavor of this coffee
54487,B001TLY7A8,Even very finicky cats eat it!,"I have three very picky cats who quickly get bored with the same old food. As a result, I am constantly on the lookout for different varieties of cat food that they will eat. Forget about any of the veterinarian supplied cat foods. My cats' response to those cat foods is consistently, ""you must be kidding!"". The weruva chicken cat food was very well received and gobbled down. But please remember, in the world of cats, variety is the answer! I rotate the foods I feed my cats each day. Just like people, cats do not like eating the same thing day in and day out, and don't hesitate to let you know their dissatisfaction."
73946,B004JRKEH4,This one is a bit spicy. Tastes a bit heavy.,"My family and friends tried this. Unfortunately no one seems to agree to buy this again. This is too spicy for most of kids. Some complained it tastes a bit artificial and less natural. Others claim is is a bit too heavy. Of course, each one has its taste, and we are a small sample, but even so our small feedback is not that positive on this one."
18442,B004IJR8WM,Sooooo... Good,"I did not find this product to be oily at all.  I buy them at our local health food store and mix them with a variety of organic nuts, raisins and coconut. Everyone I've shared them with has enjoyed them a well.  Maybe the other reviewer just happened to get a bad batch?  Who knows, but our family loves this product."
4813,B00139TT72,My dog thrives on this,"I have a 10 year old Aussie shep/heeler mix with chronic skin allergies -- I tried him on every premium dog food including grain free protein only formulas -- and none helped.  Other organic dog food also make him itch miserably.  But on the Newman's Own he's stopped the itching and shedding, and he absolutely devours this stuff.  LOVE IT!!!!"
500332,B003QNLUTI,Husband prefers it to Red Bull,For the longest time my husband drank Red Bull to give him that buzz. But it's always short lived so he always brought a few to work. This one seems to be working for him. Obviously it's much smaller than a Red Bull but it gives you more boost. Not 5 hours as advertised but at least a bit longer than Red bull. He likes the taste too.
39497,B000FDLB8M,for my hcg diet,"I bought these for my HCG diet, along with melba rounds. I must say, they are not only completely broken into bits, but also not the greatest tasting.  In fact, very little taste at all...and VERY dry and hard to swallow without a big glass of water."
5207,B000G1X456,Great for Strong Coffee lovers--Simply the best coffee!!!,"If you like strong coffee, this is it!  The flavor is exceptional, I have not found better in a can.  This can be expensive and difficult to find at your local store.  I have had great luck with Amazon, good price for the subscription order (you can get a case a couple times a year and still get the reduced rate).  Amazon also has a wonderful return policy!<br />Try Yuban if you love strong coffee and have not found the coffee for you, this may be it!  We have been drinking it for 10+ years now & have had the Original, Organic and Dark Roast---I dont have a preference, they are all excellent."
361300,B003PFR8H0,Upset my stomach,I tried these because they were recommended to me by a friend.  She forgot to tell me how much they would irritate my stomach.  The only way I can use them is to add them to a full glass of water and then slowly sip it.  That keeps me going but I would rather drink Sugar-free Red Bull.  It's going to take some time to consume all the bottles I purchased since I will probably only use them when I need to carry something small with me.
65477,B001EQ55ZO,A unique nut that bites back,The Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper cashew is a break from the normal salted cashew.<br />The back pepper adds a Cajun flavor to the obsequious cashew. The result is a unique flavor that makes other cashews seem bland by comparison. It makes me want to taste a cashew without any salt at all. The black pepper adds enough flavor that I think the salt may be unnecessary.
377870,B002GJ9JY6,Expired,"The product was expired for a year before I received it. It was unusable, and I had to throw it away."
4853,B00139TT72,How dogfood should be,"This dogfood has never been recalled, has protein as the first two ingredients, and is organic. Doesnt make my dog throw up like when she tries other dogfoods full of fat and fakeness. Cant get better!"
1979,B005HGAVGA,ddjj,I too was a little disappointed with the mix of the Donut Sampler. In my case I had 12 of the 35 were decaf.  But I guess this is what you get when you purchase a sampler pack through the Amazon warehouse deals section.  All the k-cups had a best used by date of 6/2012.  I was happy about that atleast.
490890,B004DN7MI8,Good Value,I purchase this product for the office. The clients like it and it is not too over-powering. I appreciate the savings through Subscribe & Save!
126738,B003IHO8LE,Not worth the money.,"Didn't make me happier, and I didn't like the taste either...Actually, none of their drinks worked (I bought all  of them).<br /><br />If you want bliss, try iboga, like 20-50mg per morning on your tongue."
228619,B00247AU8Y,A Good Accent For All Kinds Of Food,I use this on steaks and mix it into scrambled eggs just for a tiny bit of extra flavor and a bit of a kick.
4247,B004391DK0,Delicious Pancakes!,"As tasty as the regular (gluten) product. Only drawback is that you don't get a lot of mix for your money. Half of the box is needed to make their 12 pancake recipe. On a good note, it's nice to have options - by far though, this was the best pancake mix I've tried...and I tried a lot!"
7341,B000I6O6RO,Coffee Masters Coffee,This brand of coffee is excellent; you can really taste the flavors unlike many store bought flavored coffees I have tried. I like the individual packets as they stay fresh longer and I just use what I need out of the packet so it lasts a long time. I would highly recommend this coffee; it's worth the price!!!
322673,B006TJVY42,unsatisfied,This is the only guava jelly ive tried but it tastes like apple sauce. The shipping was prompt but i was disappointd with the flavor
42391,B003VTNBQ2,Heavy on the cinnamon flavor,This creamer is very heavy on the cinnamon flavor and light on vanilla. I was very disappointed and now am stuck with 4 boxes of it.
2243,B002C4HZ00,Not sure what I got,"Received Different than pictured. Labels Just say ""certified"" not ""D.O.P. CERTIFIED"". Don't know if that is the same and after a couple of orders I am not going to put the effort in to find out.<br />Also came with Basil. I want tomatoes only. Not Basil.<br />A couple cans dented like others have said.<br />My case was $44 now its $60.<br />I'm over the tomato thing. I'll buy what I want in the store."
29670,B0001GUQ20,Great stuff but pricy on Amazon,I have been using Minor's stock for years.<br /><br />Family and friends rave about the stock base that my wife and I use.<br /><br />I Buy it at BJ's which is about half of Amazon's price not counting the shipping cost.
250260,B0027UYT4O,Lid was chipped but I like the product,Came to me with a chipped lid.  I wrote an email to the company to see what I could do and no one responded.
299969,B0002ASCO4,Bad  Product,"The door on the litter box gets stuck inside the box, trapping your cat inside.<br /><br />Avoid this product."
66650,B000E1HVFM,Tasty Ofcourse!,Who doesn't like French Vanilla?!?!?! I use this for a snack or to make banana pudding or evening to give away when it gets close to the expiration date.
42,B001EO5QW8,Oatmeal For Oatmeal Lovers,"McCann's makes oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur, whether one likes it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour, to the sloth addled instant, which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes. It's all good, that's for sure, and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular.<br />  This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored, as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCann's and other well-known oatmeals. What I personally like about McCann's is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America. The Apples & Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.<br />  The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you'll end up with six ten-count boxes. This is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal-eaters, but if you're a single person alone -- well, love oatmeal."
75014,B0026RQTGE,Dogs love 'em,"Our dogs love these.  The vet always compliments us on brushing the dogs' teeth, but we never have.  (Seriously, if someone has ever accomplished this without the dog making various dramatic escape attempts and trying to eat the toothpaste, please tell me your secret.)  We just give them each one of these every day and a bunch of rawhide to chew on, seems to do the trick."
123697,B000IJKSAK,a funny gag,at my office all the smokers get a 10 minute smoking break. I handed out candy cigarettes to all the non-smokers and now we get a break too
198553,B000FVBYCW,great product,I bought this for treating symptoms of menopause.  It has been a life saver.  thank you
71238,B000LKTDIO,i still havent gotten my shipment,"dont purchase this product unless you have plenty of time to wait for its arrival.  it has been over a month since i placed my order and i still have not received my shipment, nor have i received any communication from nutricity stating a reason for the delay, or even that i should expect a delay."
81823,B005CUU25G,Didn't work so well for me,"I think this product might work well in some situations.  For me, my dog was very small when I got it, and right after receiving it, he needed to be trained without treats.  Then, when he was 9 months old, about 4 months after receiving the product, I decided to try it again, as he was at that age where he knows he should come when called, but is a bit defiant about it.  By then, the stuff in the bottle had gotten a bit thick, and the roller didn't work too well.  I used it a little anyway, just forcing the ball to roll with my finger, but I then left it in my coat pocket, and when I wasn't paying attention, Archie bit into the pocket and crushed the bottle and it oozed out inside my pocket - arghh!  Not the product's fault, obviously.  It could definitely work, but I think I will just stick with the old standard kibbles in a plastic bag for now anyway."
4072,B001EW5YQS,Too Cheap,"Owned two of these and when they work they are fine.  The power knob has no indicator on it though.  My biggest problem, and the reason I will NEVER purchase another, is this: both gave out with in a year.  One now sounds like I am recording from behind a wall and one developed a hum that will not go away.  Do yourself a favor and find a more reliable option."
61837,B000BLNU6E,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"DOES NOT LOOK LIKE PICTURE, AND DOES NOT INCLUDE THE SAME ITEMS PICTURED.  DO NOT BUY THIS AS A GIFT, AS RECIPIENT WILL BE DISAPPOINTED."
12543,B000FEJ11U,"Not cheese, salt","We ordered the product and received 2 broken bottles, but Amazon is excellent and reshipped the entire order again one day shipping.  Unfortunately, even at 85 cents a bottle, we overpaid.  There is NO cheese taste and it is really just a salty mess.  Now we have 10 bottles of a below average product.  Save your money."
8675,B003VXFK44,Taste like old socks,I thought this coffee was really horrible. Had one cup and will throw the rest away because it can't be returned.
4754,B00139TT72,great dog food for my min pin 14 lb. dog!!!,"I believe that dog food should be what your dog likes to start with.<br /><br />Next, I think that you should do research to make sure it is right for<br /><br />your pooch!!! All human grade products go into the dog food, another<br /><br />decision is the size, and for 14 lbs. a 7 pound bag is perfect!!! Buying<br /><br />at Amazon is a great way to buy, because they have the 7 pounder!!!"
49681,B000CRHQN0,Ehhhhh.... Not that great....,I ended giving these to my husband simply because the calories were 240!!!!!!! I also didn't care for the taste.. I would rather have a real scoop of peanut butter than an artificial flavor taste any day.. and the search goes on.....
143336,B0007A0AQM,Payton LOVES these!,My lil pup loves his treats! Recently when I was visiting my moms house he found his way under and was being a lil explorer and I shook the bag of treats and he came running. I ordered a bag to try then ordered two more shortly after. Only thing I found was strage is that the packaging went from 2 calories to 3 per treat- no biggie just weird.
1514,B003UIDAHY,Fabulous product,I don't know how they do it but this product is too good to be true.  Half the calories of regular pasta!! Wow.
443381,B000MXJR7C,Ingredients listed on this page are incorrect.,As of the date of this posting the ingredients listed on this page are incorrect. Please check the Gerber webpage for the correct ingredients.
305,B001UJEN6C,"Flavor getting better, energy is great","I've been buying and drinking this for over a year now, and the energy boost is excellent, with a continuous, ~6-hour effect. The most recent shipments seem to have improved the flavor slightly as well, or perhaps I'm getting more used to it. I don't drink it for the flavor, but it's not as heinous as the fake flavors found in the other, non-organic energy shots."
4467,B000I6G2OO,Woderful Wild Rasberry French Twists,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6G2OO"">Barry's Bakery French Twist, Wild Raspberry, 4.5-Ounce Box (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />I really love this product.  It is not available in our area.  We discoverd it in the North while visiting friends. It is low cal and good for diabetics who need a sugar fix.  Keep a good supply for future orders."
8683,B003VXFK44,Average offering from Wolfgang Puck,"So here is another example of a 48-pack of k-cups I bought ""untested"".  I figured, well, I really enjoy Sumatra's bold, smooth and rich with a bit of bitterness flaver, so why not?  Wolfgang puck has a few restaurants, so maybe he knows coffee.<br /><br />So, this is utterly average in all departments.  It's not very bold or rich, although I can say it does have the bitterness, which is a bit unbalanced as it lacks the richness.  Purchased only because it appeared on the Subscribe & Save at a great price per k-cup.  That makes two WP's that have been run of the mill at best [Sumatra & French roast].  Next time I'll be more discerning."
8312,B003VXFK44,Wonderful coffee!,This is a great cup of hazelnut coffee; smooth and balanced with no chemical aftertaste.  My husband and I like it so much that we've ordered it twice directly from the Keurig manufacturer.  SO GLAD that it's now available on Amazon through subscribe and save!
1815,B001RVFDOO,Cross between Pringles and a rice cake. The bonus is they're all natural,"They're okay, but not the most amazing thing ever.<br /><br />~ The Good ~<br />Good flavor, no too strong or weak.<br />Crunchy, but not too dry.<br />Plenty of chips in each bag. Not just filled with air.<br />Not greasy, so makes a good on-the-go snack.<br />All natural, using no artificial flavors or colors.<br /><br />~ The Bad ~<br />Sill plenty of fat per bag (3.5 grams per bag of the sour cream flavor) so don't get them expecting them to be low fat.<br />Tastes like a low-fat chip, but with all the fat of regular chips.<br /><br />~ Conclusion ~<br />I'm 50/50 on if I'll order them again. I have a finicky stomach, and so I'm fine with things that taste low-fat and healthy, since those are mostly what I eat. But these have all the fat and calories of chips that are fried and even more than those that are baked, so I'm undecided on if I want more chips that have a healthy taste with all the fat. The all natural ingredients are what make this chip different, and what might bring me back for more. It's definitely one of those snacks you have to try for yourself, and see if you like them or not."
7269,B00382UXU4,Pretty good stuff,"Good: Big, crisp, snowy-white kernels with few duds. Pops quickly, 25% faster than name-brand yellow corn in the same microwave and popper.  Decent price and package size - enough to last awhile; not so much as to go stale before it runs out.<br /><br />Bad: Almost tasteless.  Butter and salt are not optional.<br /><br />Orville Redenbacher still leads the pack, but this stuff is pretty good and costs a LOT less.  Four stars; would have been five if it were even a little less bland."
4920,B0009JMW1C,Have to make the tea strong.,I am having to change my original post on this tea. My husband and I both suffer from sinus problems. I made up a big tea pot (with 2 tea bags) and let it steep for 15 minutes. I had 2 cups and my husband had one. Neither of us noticed any difference with our sinuses. A few days later I decided to try the tea again. I brewed one cup of tea with one tea bag. I let it sit again for several minutes. I guess the first time I tried it I did not make it strong enough. This time I noticed a difference as my sinuses are a little clearer.
325955,B000VJUIN4,Best Tasting Honey Ever!,My title for this review says it all. This will be my choice for honey!!
60299,B001ELL3LY,Tastes Great but Mixes Poorly,"I was looking for organic nonfat dry milk and tried this product, but it is hard to dissolve.  The powder does not dissolve readily and it cannot be added to hot drinks without being mixed thoroughly with cold water first.  I will probably go back to my previous non-organic choice."
134559,B003E728CE,Fabulous resource for the reluctant pill taker,This makes giving daily pills a snap. Our dog thinks she is getting a treat all the time when all she is doing is getting her meds.
7908,B00166D8TW,Great product,Good taste...mixes easy and has no artifical sweetners.  I been using this one for years
107704,B001F0RRTQ,My dog loves these!,"My choc lab Dane just loves these treats!! He has learned when I ask him to get ""treat toy"" to go and find it and bring it to me. He watches me add the treat to the toy and will actually howl with excitement!! The only problem is that he has it mastered and the treats are gone within min's. But reguardless, he loves them and I will continue to give them to him! Also, the service from this seller is A++++++++++++!!!"
13575,B001ZSF9EI,"Good, just not what I wanted","Now that the Pounce Hairball Treats are discontinued, I needed to find a new way of hiding treats for my cat's twice-daily medicine. I was hoping that these would be pliable enough to wrap around the very small pill. Unfortunately, they crumble whenever any pressure is applied. The cat adores them, but I have to be very careful when giving her her meds now, and make sure she eats the pill, not just the treat.<br /><br />Once these are gone, I'll be looking for something else."
73398,B000EPOC28,disappointing,"We were big fans of Midel graham crackers before we moved to Canada.  We couldn't find them here and so we were thrilled to find them on Amazon.  The ones we received from Amazon are quite different from what we were used to buying off the shelf in the States.  They are small squares, not regular graham cracker sizes, and as has been noted, they're all broken up, even the flimsy trays that hold the crackers are broken up.  Finally, down to our last 4 boxes, they've gone rancid from lack of being used and we can throw them out guilt-free.  Even though we're huge fans of Midel Graham Crackers we'll never buy these again.  Too bad."

3492,B005K4Q1VI,Downright awful!,"I have never tasted such a poor excuse for a cocoa drink. It has such a bad aftertaste that I checked the box to see if I ordered sugarfree by mistake! I will toss this  and chalk it up to a loss but if you are reading this, dont buy this brand. Its downright awful!"
542737,B005UO5ZC4,My son loves these,"After having my son undergo a physiological performance evaluation, the doctor said that my son needed to have 50g of carbs before and in the middle of his work outs, especially when he swims.  These energy blasts provide the necessary amount of carbs for my son when he complements them with another fruit or a gatorade.  My son loves the flavor and we have them delivered once a month."
76173,B0055QVU6M,"Baby wouldn't drink it, didn't help much, insane price","From crazzeto's wife:<br />My baby developed a milk intolerance and very bad acid reflux around 2 months so we had to switch from breastmilk to Nutramigen and she HATED it. We had to flavor every bottle with expensive vanilla powder just to get her to drink it, and she still had a lot of pain and feeding difficulties. It's also three or four times more expensive than other types of formula, and honestly I think it is mostly because the company knows that if your baby needs it this is your only option and will have to pay whatever price they give you. We ended up switching to Similac Sensitive after a while and although she had more reactions to it, at least she would actually drink it and gain weight (unlike with this stuff) and it was cheaper too."
35302,B002DVVP6W,Too salty!,"I've purchased the Santa Fe Salsa flavor before and these were pretty tasty, so I had high hopes for Salty Pepper. Sadly, they are disgustingly salty. As in I only managed to eat two of them before I had to go look for my water bottle. Bleh!"
22232,B000KV61FC,Not as pictured...,"The picture shown does not match the item I received. I specifically ordered this product because it showed the jug to have a plastic rope and not an actual rope (my dog loves to tear apart ropes,  and I'd had a tug-a-jug that had the plastic rope previously and that was a great product. I'm not sure if they're making it with the plastic rope anymore, but I assumed that since that was what was shown, that's what I'd receive.) I'm not really happy with this bait and switch because I have to closely monitor my dog with this toy to make sure she doesn't shred the rope and render it useless."
77692,B001LG940E,Okay alternative to soda,"I was intrigued by this Black Cherry carbonated 100% juice. I have to admit, on my first taste, I hated it. But I took a few more sips, I began to get used to it and like it a bit more. I could definitely taste the cherry in the drink and a hint of apple. Although, I'm not big on carbonated drinks that aren't soda. Also it may have a lot of pluses in what it doesn't put into your drink but if you're watching your calorie intake, The Switch Black Cherry has 130 calories and it's no different than what some soda and juice (like lemonade) have. It always seems slightly strange to me so I probably won't make a permanent switch to The Switch. The price of The Switch is another drawback. To me, $22.99 is a bit much for a 24 pack of 8.3 Ounce cans."
3828,B000X2CWTM,THE BEST LICORICE,This is by far my favorite licorice....to the point I have a case delivered on a regular monthly basis......an option offered by Amazon......a VERY convenient service......
20275,B001BDDTB2,"If it looks good, is it good for the cats?","My two traditional striped cats eat mostly dry Science Diet cat food with a few NuCat vitamins added.  They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.  Brownie prefers the dry food but will eat some canned food only when the can is freshly opened.  Pi likes both.  We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.  A 1995 study in Japan found that cats that ate tuna had a higher concentration of mercury in their fur than cats that ate dry cat food.  The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term ""all about tuna fish"".  I posted a question on the Petite Cuisine web site as to whether they had tested their products for mercury.  I have not received an answer.  My conclusion is that it may be ok to give the cats fish as an occasional treat but not as a steady diet."
252528,B000YW7Q0Q,Yumm,It was delivered faster than the number of days it took to eat all of them. Will purchase again soon!
4001,B00110FN28,"Good ""store bought"" cookies","I really like the ""crunchy"" chocolate chip cookies . . . the soft ones are chemically softened and, I think, gross.  These have good flavor and are great for trips (although eating anything crunchy in the car is discouraged . . . wait for a rest stop!) and especially for preschooler snacks."
73858,B001E5E3IA,Not Considered Natural in the Rest of the World,Erythritol is a highly processed sugar alcohol polyol which is considered in Europe as synthetic and is not classed as natural nor organic.

6218,B000NY31I6,Excellent!,This Creme Brulee is better than some of the better French restaurants I've been to. I just wish my local grocery stores would carry it!
11955,B001CD1VI4,Not so good!,The breakfast cookie is not to my liking and I do not think I will order them in the future!
9256,B006N3IG4K,I liked it,smooth.  I normally drink dark roasts but purchased this on a lightning deal (or maybe a friday sale).  I like it.
547,B000G6RYNE,"Taste terrible, way too strong","Unless you like salt vinegar chips as salty as eating actual pinches of salt and drinking actual vinegar, i doubt you will like these chips.  These are the saltiest & sourest chips I have ever had, and the only reason stops me from throwing these away is because I paid for 2 full boxes and dont like to waste food.  The brown chips are especially bad, besides being salty and sour, they also taste overcooked and burnt.  Unless you are the rare kind that can take this kind of extreme taste, you will not like these chips.<br /><br />I actually have a high tolerance for sour taste, so I can down a bag of chips with a bit of difficulty.  But normal people, please do not try this at home."
4245,B004391DK0,great baking aid,This is an excellent product and I use it just like I used to utilize the regular Bisquick product.It works well with any recipe that calls for flour and quickening.
62145,B000CQG8K8,Remarkable,"A friend of mine brought this tea to work one day to share.<br /><br />I am prepared to drop coffee altogether. It has captured my sences and ""Bravo"" to the genious behind it."
1541,B000E7WM0K,More than just a taste of Thai,"Provided you use clean (preferably purified) water to cook this, it can be a great tasting hold over to a main meal. Far superior to most instant noodle packages out there and for the most part, gluten and meat free (except for the shrimp flavor).<br /><br />While some people have remarked on the ""over-sized"" packaging, this actually allows for a good and thorough mixing of the flavor packets and noodles with little chance of spillage.<br /><br />While the coconut ginger variety tastes good, it may be a bit too subtle for those looking for an actual ""taste of THAI."" I'd recommend the Thai Peanut noodles for those seeking something with a bit more of a pronounced Thai flavor and highly recommend The A Taste Of Thai Peanut Salad Dressing (added to salads, meats or the Peanut Noodles) for a very spicy Thai experience.<br /><br />Overall for the taste and quantity, the subscribe and save offer provides the best deal. Comparatively speaking in terms of price, Wal-Mart offers most of these noodles a few cents cheaper (compared to the subscription price) but do not seem to carry the Coconut Ginger Variety. At least not at the store near me.<br /><br />If you haven't tried this brand of instant noodles yet, I think you'll be in for a treat."
5030,B001EO6BCC,do not buy these,most of the nuts in these bags were so old they had turned black totally worthless will never order again
8711,B003VXFK44,Nice mellow cup of coffee!,"I bought this grudgingly because my favorite Timothy's Italian Blend was out of stock...... and I was very happily surprised! It's not as ""big""  and winey a brew as my favorite, but was flavorful, had a delicious aroma and was smooth. I tend to like rather potent coffee but I have clients who prefer a little lighter cup..... this will be perfect! I will happily keep buying this coffee. Thanks Wolfgang!"
5618,B000LDOMT6,"Great service ,!!!",I have ordered this product twice now and the service and product have been great.  Would order again !!!<br />Price of product was comparable to others. Thank you....
73367,B0026ECPB0,terrible,This product is over salted and so foul of artificial flavor that its not worth anything. A waste of money.
14015,B0045XE32E,Not great for little dogs - otherwise OK,"These snacks/treats have excellent ingredients and are suitable for dogs who can chew them up. The one problem is that they are VERY hard and thus not great for small dogs or dogs who have trouble with hard treats. The biscuits are not large enough to be broken up by hand. If you want to break them up, you basically need to use a hammer.<br /><br />Bottom line - good for medium/large dogs or those who can deal with very hard snacks."
252947,B000UWCZLA,shipping???,I have not bought yet...need to know how can a 25 pound bag go into a box and only weigh a total shiping weight of 20 and 1/2 pounds?
7454,B001D6KP14,Great Brew -- Will Try Again,"I brewed this kit first as it was the one that came with the brewery kit. I followed the instructions exactly. NOTE: If you don't follow the instructions exactly you are opening up opportunity for problems. I brewed for about 7 days. I then bottled and let condition for 2 weeks at room temperature. I then put the beer in the fridge. I tried two bottles the next day. The taste was OK, but it was very flat. I then put more bottles in the fridge and let them sit for 2 weeks. I tried one of these after the two weeks and it was great. The carbonation was perfect and the taste improved even more. Definitely give the beer time to condition. You will be glad you did."
264146,B004EAGP74,good product,"husband is using every day and says there is no coconut taste.  he adds it to his oatmeal every morning.  just a note to those purchasing it, it does have a low melting temp!"
291235,B001E55Z46,Fa proprio schifo!,This is not Parmesan. Why do they say that? They must put another name for this product. Don't buy if you need Parmesan cheese!
1841,B001RVFDOO,Satisfies the salty snack craving,"The cheddar tastes a little weird, but that could be personal preference. The salt and vinegar is very strong, but tastes okay other than that.  Salt and pepper is yum!  Barbeque is good too.  Plain is plain.  If you're a die hard potato chip lover and don't care about calories, don't bother with these.  However, if you want your salty snacks and don't want all the calories, these work.  I'd buy them again."
374688,B002AN8F52,Be Careful,"The picture of this item shows a 13 ounce can, but they are actually selling a 12 pack of 6 ounce cans."
5160,B000WMPGDW,Heavenly!,"A friend brought me this from Argentina and my kids and I ate it with a spoon and then apples so that I would feel less guilty. When we finished, I immediately panicked because I wasn't sure if I could get it here in the U.S. Low and behold I found it on Amazon. It is different packaging but same company so I assume it is just catering to Americans. Delicious!"
39159,B001HWD2OG,"great prices, fast delivery!",My dog is addicted to these and they're actually fully digestible and don't hurt anything. I've purchased them from everywhere on the planet and will buy from here from now on!

We keep it in the freezer and everytime we open it the aroma of the coffee fills the room. I also purchased a couple of these american brands and will review then once we try them, for know this one is a winner. By the way, I paid $10 for one of this at safeway."

At work, we have a water cooler with hot water dispenser.  This brewed in hot water just like a tea bag making tea tastes far better than any instant coffee.  I highly recommend it to any coffee lover when you have access to very hot water but don't have access to a coffee maker.  Individual wrapped and sealed bags allow you to take one tiny tea like bag with you in your pocket or purse to your early morning meetings."

8757,B000LKZ84C,At last we find a food fit for human consumption,"And we find her here upon this grand amazon!<br /><br />Each day Morinu feeds me like my own nourishing mother, cherishes and consents my whims with this wonderful food.<br /><br />Eschew all animal byproducts and cadavers.<br /><br />This tofu is a strengthening food, fit for human consumption.<br /><br />And so convenient from our mighty amazon, sent right to your front porch or, in my case, post office box with free shipping rather than driving thirty to seventy five miles for the same product at three times the price, plus gas.<br /><br />This is fit food for humans, food for which our bodies are created, food which feeds us rather than kills both the source and the consumer.<br /><br />You may read here written by the self-deceived that this tofu is too mushy for firmness and that it must be pressed between towels before cooking. To them so confused I ask<br /><br />Cooking?<br /><br />Each day at least once a day, I draw forth my serrated knife, and one sacrificial box of this excellent tofu, and I without remorse slice a hole in its top, with great tenderness and care and gratitude, releasing only the slightest and most apologetic gentle spurt of clearest liquid.<br /><br />And this with a certain yearning.<br /><br />I do not observe the indications written sternly upon the short edge of the box, but lie this box gently down upon a smooth flat slab of wood, with the face up, and take the knife very gently sliding upon on edge of the top, the very belly of the box, and then upon the other edge of this top, and then most gently along the bottom edge of this top, each time releasing apologetically the slightest hint of a clear liquid, revealing thusly by means of these three slits the gentle hidden secrets of the box, the soft white substance lying shyly within, awaiting with embarrassment our further processing.<br /><br />I feel the need to explain this procedure with greater care and attention. The very tip, the point of the knife, uncovers tenderly a certain point a certain distance from the corner of the broad top of the box, the side with the picture and product label, as pictured here, the side which reads Morinu, the broad flat side laid flat. The very tip of the knife, I say, discovers probingly a certain point near one corner which offers the proper resistance without too great a resistance, without too little a resistance, to penetrate this membrane. Too close to the corner is found to be too hard, too resistant, too unwilling, although most convenient for the later proceedings. Too distant from the corner implies simply random slashings without specific purpose, and our purpose in this procedure is most serious, most purposeful, intent.<br /><br />In a word therefore the point of the knife penetrates the membrane slowly yet purposefully as close to the corner as possible, penetrating as deeply as possible without piercing the wooden slab beneath. A certain spurt of clear liquid may emerge, but let this prove no inhibition, as the knife reaches the depth of the box. Slowly withdraw the knife, slowly, at a diagonal, allowing the serration softly with friction to continue to separate a slight slit along the ege of the box, slowly, resolutely but patiently, with purpose, as the serration creates an ever longer slit along that edge, as closely as possible.<br /><br />Continue from this first slit along the the contiguous edge of the top of this box, and then the third edge, inserting carefully your knife, and slowly withdrawing with a friction sufficient to separate the membrane without shredding, without eliciting over muchly the clear liquid which may spurt forth.<br /><br />Let us call the top right corner of the box Point A, the bottom right corner Point B, the left bottom corner Point C and the upper left corner Point D. Begin to pierce at Point A, proceed in turn to B, to C, ending at D, forming this a slit along the three edges. Arriving at Point D, withdraw the knife completely, wipe the blade with a soft, dry cloth and set it aside for cleansing. We now may lift the flap thus created, exposing the delicate white contents within.<br /><br />I feel remiss if I do not address a probable misconception here writtenonly for the rhetorical convenience, and I feel compelled by the necesity of correcting this counter-indication, no matter how unclear this may be, due only to my severely limiting literary incapacities.<br /><br />Employing the same alphabetical coordinates as described above, the consumer may discover this procedure far more efficacious: to begin at Point A and proceed gently yet firmly to point B as described. Divergently, however, please proceed to point D (!) and then directly by knife edge to point C, parallel to the Line AB already created, yet along the opposing edge. Having thusly formed two parallel slits, find the midpoint between Point B and Point C as close to the edge as possible, probing and then plunging the tip of the knife through the cardboard membrane, through to the bottom of the box, but now with an orientation perpendicular to that previously used in the formation of lines AB and DC. Withdraw slowly, delicately, yet with sufficient friction at an angle to proceed effectively to the corner at Point B. Withdraw completely and reverse the knife blade, returning it deeply at the midpoint previously entered. Withdraw once more with similar care, and opposite diagonal, completing the slit thus formed entirely to Point C. I am confident the consumer may discover this procedure far more delightful and effective than any here previously described.<br /><br />Firmly we roll back the top flap created by the three slits. Proceed mercilessly, proceed, not frenetically, but ardently nevertheless, to dice within the selfsame box her contents, slowly, gently, but decisively. The fresh tip of my serrated knife, which in recent memory has touched no animal part, but vegetable alone, and never shall become so adulterate with the blood of the animal, with the dairy of the animal, this sanctified and reserved and faithful tip, having never known in any sense animal but only vegetable, purified thus, unadulterate, this sacred knife dares therefore pierce this gentle pure white tofu into a ruthless grid of slits, fully through to the bottom box, plunging first vertically in rhythmically repeated rows spaced gently a few centimeters apart, and then, relentlessly, horizontally, pushing ever so softly through the yielding, unresisting white tofu laid back upon the flat slab, awaiting without a word this process, with utter patience, yielding.<br /><br />Completed this repeated slicing, back and forth, up and down, across, and through, and through, I lift in one hand upwards the entire box gently, yet unrelentingly, over the recipient reserved for this purpose alone. Most often it is the daily lunch container, reusable, with soft top, to receive the more securely and gently this daily offering, removed demurely from its box, as cautiously as a hermit crab from its borrowed shell, vulnerable by exposure. With one finger one may remove whatever residue remains relunctly within the package, passing it reassuringly into the ultimate recipient.<br /><br />Lime juice freshly squeezed upon the tofu deposited there, as ablution, meets fragrant sprigs of fresh green cilantro mated with whole <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JMFCRU"">Corriander Seeds 7oz</a>, and a generous ladling of the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GZU7QQ"">Eden Organic Garbanzo Beans, 15-Ounce Unit (Pack of 12)</a> also available upon this generously nutrient amazon. This is a meal in itself, and comes most welcome at noon.<br /><br />At night rather than such a cold lunch, in this cold winter a warmer meal is wanted, and so this gentle and yielding box of nutritious tofu might discover herself pushed gently into a saucepan of simmering miso soup, such as, perhaps, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RMB4WI"">Shiro Miso Paste NON GMO No MSG Added</a>. This miso soup would take far greater space to describe here in the making. From this container of miso paste draw forth a goodly spoonful to introduce slowly, most politely, into a gently heating small saucepan of water. Later, in place of seaweed and to deceive my own palate, I place those small flat spinach leaves available in the organic department of your local market, perhaps with the results of a small onion diced very carefully in the manner approved as described above, or green onion.<br /><br />When quite ready for dinner, I add last of all to this essence this gentle box of tofu, sliced as described above, with great and tender care, leaving it bathing one might dare say, only long enough to warm through and through, before eating.<br /><br />A veritable meal in itself.<br /><br />There are so many other manners in which to use, and to abuse, this pure, white and utterly nutritious gentle product, and I can only with my utmost recommendation say, and this with my greatest gratitude, that here at long last we may know a food most willingly fit for our human consumption, and one most readily available upon this wonderful amazon."

(unless you like that sort of thing, which we don't so it's nice to actually find a potato side dish with no cheese in it).<br /><br />Anyways- - these are surprisingly good and they toast up nicely in the oven in like 10 minutes.  worth it for $10."

76247,B0036EYL8E,AWFUL!! Not worth the bottle its packaged in!,"This drink is tasteless, it tastes like watered down KoolAid.<br />It's no wonder it's 30% ""Lower in sugar"" as it's only 60% juice, ie, it's 30% lower in Juice!<br />I'm hoping to find good use for the bottle, as the drink itself was a waste of money."
9010,B006N3IG4K,Too Mild for Me,"I bought this because Amazon had DRASTICALLY increased the price on what I usually buy, so I thought I'd try something new.  I normally drink Coffee People Donut Shop, which is a nice, strong cup of coffee.  This was a little disappointing.  It's called a Medium Roast, but when I brew a large cup (my Keurig has 3 size options), it looks like strong tea - very light in color.  It makes a very weak cup of coffee.  When I brew the smallest cup possible, it's a tiny bit better, but I prefer a large cup of strong coffee.  Think I may try the Rodeo Drive or Sorrento, but this one is just too weak and light for me.  (Oddly enough, the first time I tried Donut Shop, I thought it was too strong...as I had been used to weaker coffees.  Now that I've started drinking the stronger varieties, it's hard to go back to ""brown water."")"
5321,B000BYLQW6,Vitakraft carob dog treats,"The product is great...but it arrived mostly melted together instead of individual drop pieces.  I am sure it was over heated in the shipping.

I am  able to use them, anyway, by just cutting them up.<br />Partly my fault...I will try to remember to order during the winter months for cooler weather.<br />Excellent product..."
259,B00821UN4M,Disappointed!,"This product has a strong after-taste of Crayola crayons!<br /><br />I am in the process of trying different brands of coconut oils for cooking purposes.  Upon opening the plastic container, the aroma of crayons immediately fills the room, and this flavor permeates the food that is cooked in it.<br /><br />I suspect the source of the problem is the plastic used in the plastic container as I have not experienced this with any of the other brands purchased.<br /><br />To date, my favorite coconut oil is distributed by Barleans.  The flavor is fantastic.  However, they do not supply a gallon-sized tub,and Dr. Mercola has the best product in that size category."
465411,B0002SPRN0,the cats liked it,"We have been feeding to our cats for a couple of months, and they seem to like it. (The dog also likes it.) We like the idea that it does not have any meat products in it."
10367,B000V6FTTU,Barely edible,"I think this chunky chili is the worst store-bought chili.  The meat has the texture of artificial soybean meat and is chewy, the<br />sauce is too sweet and cloy.  This has no character.<br /><br />I prefer Hormel or Dennisons to this.  By far."
4843,B00139TT72,My dog loves it...,"and I love buying it for her. Not only is it a healthy organic meal, I personally like what the Newman Foundation does with their profits (after taxes) from their products.....$265 MILLION has been donated to various charities to date by their foundation. I buy Newman's Own products whenever I can (their spaghetti sauce is out-of-this-world...""Roasted Garlic""...YUM!).<br /><br />My dog has eaten this food for years and years until, out of the blue, my local grocer decided not to sell it anymore. I then had to grab a bag of food for her because we were out completely and decided to get Beneful. Apparently, her digestive system didn't like it and she ended up with bloody stools. That's when I came to Amazon.com (a GODSEND for people like me who have lame grocery stores to shop from) and found her Newman's Own dog food! I can always depend on Amazon.com. I've now got this on auto-delivery. I trust Newman's Own products and I know my dog is getting a well-balanced organic meal and it's Melamine-free."
6829,B001LG945O,"Unless you really want Vitamin C in your soda, not really worth it.","I liked the level of carbonation.  It was actually more highly carbonated than I was expecting, but didn't taste dry the way I would expect an artificial-sugar-free drink to taste with carbonation added.  I was hoping it would taste more ""orangey,"" but the tangerine is the more dominant flavor (along with apple, a common juice ""filler"").  Despite having ""no added sugar,"" however, there is still 34 grams worth of it in the small 8.3oz can.  Basically, other than having 100% of the daily value of Vitamin C, this drink could easily be replaced with a better tasting orange soda that is in a 12oz can and costs far less.  Unless you really like the taste, or you want to ensure your Vitamin C beverage stays fresh longer, I'd give this one a pass."

Of course, here in Iraq we look forward to receiving care packages and the awesome snacks they contain.  However, this snack was the ""Cat's Meow"".  It is honestly the best snack mix I have ever tasted and my fellow Marines agree on this also.  Once it was eaten by all, everyone was inquiring where I had received it and I could only say a caring patriot who included it in one of their care box of goodies.<br /><br />  I loved it so much that I ended up on this page because I decided to go online and search for it, and see if I can get multiple packages of this shipped to my unit here in Iraq.  I don't mind paying a few extra bucks for it, to have for me and my fellow Marines to enjoy.  It's just that good that it's worth it!!!<br /><br />  This is a great product and all should try it.  After you do, you won't think that Chex Mix can light even a dim candle next to the UTZ PUB MIX.  Believe me, try it, and you'll want to keep this stocked in your cabinet for everyone in your family and their friends to enjoy."
5249,B0012YEKCW,Excellent growth.,I planted this grass and in 8 days I had 3-4 inches of grass!<br /><br />The price hurts since you're basically paying for shipping. The cost of the seeds themselves are $1.59 as shown on the package. I couldn't find oat grass seeds at Lowes or my local independent garden center. I'm hoping to find somewhere local to buy them so I can buy more seeds in the future without having to pay a premium and wait for them to ship.
3255,B005K4Q1VI,HARD TO BELIEVE,"I don't ven know why i ordered these, it was just on a whim. But what a surprise when I brewed myself some hot chocolate.

If you are looking for an excellent blend of Pomegranate and Raspberry flavors in green tea, you maybe be very disappointed like I do."

The flavor is great, very good tomato taste with a good bit of tanginess.  Not sweet at all but there is a hint of tomato sweetness.  I never thought I'd find something this good in a can.  I bought one because it looked out of place on the store shelf so it had to be good.  I've read reviews on a pizza making forum and most of the people grudgingly concede its a good sauce."

8272,B000VK6NDC,Great quality food and my cats LOVE it.,"I've been on the hunt for high quality cat food that doesn't cost a fortune. After a lot of research at various sites Petguard was one on my list to try, so I ordered a case from amazon and couldn't be happier. 2/3 of my cats LOVE it, the 3rd cat is a dry food addict and I'm in the process of trying to convert her but it's slow going. Be warned though, this stuff smells terrible, opening a can and dishing it out is like being slapped in the face with a week old mackerel, but that's how cats like it.<br /><br />Bottom line this food is reasonably priced and high quality. It has low carbs, low ash/magnesium, high protein, real human grade meat with no by-products, the vitamins/minerals are chelated for better absorption and Petguard has stated they do not use BPA lined cans. Also, contrary to what the ingredient list here on Amazon says it does NOT contain ""Menadione Sodium Bisulfite"" or at least the case I ordered doesn't have any listed, so they must have stopped using it, which is a big plus."

7214,B004AC0OF0,Good,"My Experience:<br /><br />It's very translucent, with just a light golden color. It smells like you'd expect a peach to smell, but the taste hints of a white grape juice, though it has no grape in it and tastes more peachy over time, especially as it warms up. It's tingly on the tongue, but doesn't foam up. It's slightly drier than your average juice, with a hint of bitterness, probably from the carbonation.<br /><br />Did I Like it: Yes, though not as much as their offering in Pomegranate-Apple, a 6 out of 10. My wife doesn't like it so much."

I have drunk blue mountain for years when I can but this was shocking.  It tasted stale when you opened the bag and even worse when you drank it.  It was definitely off.  He bought 5 bags and every one we tried was the same.  I would never buy another.  We had bought another brand in a tin from Jamaica which was fine.  I think this is a con.  You get all the rubbish about it being tested in Jamaica, well I dont know who tests it but definitely not someone who likes good coffee.  I just dont understand how people say its any good. Maybe having paid so much for it its like the emperor's new clothes."

It has just the right amount of flavor; not too overpowering and not too bland.  I fried some whiting with it and a family friend said it was the best fish he ever tasted.<br /><br />A suggestion for those who like really crispy fish is to combine the product with corn meal before frying.  I use a 50/50 ratio.<br /><br />Buying it this way from Amazon is a money-saver because of the free shipping and Amazon's great price.  I saved about $1.25 a box (compared to buying it from the supermarket).  Also, having it shipped to me is much more convenient.<br /><br />I fully recommend Golden Dipt Cajun Fish Fry Mix.  I believe you'll be pleased buying it from Amazon."

7963,B004WM0ZTS,"A smooth, well-balanced cup of coffee","I've been a fan of Starbucks Via since it was first introduced.  As a pregnant (and now breastfeeding) woman, my caffeine intact is restricted to one cup of coffee a day.  I'm lazy and not willing to go to the trouble to make a pot of coffee for just one cup, so I switched to Via.  I don't think I'll ever go back.  I've tried all the Via varieties, including the Decaf Italian Roast and the various flavor blends (mocha, vanilla, etc.).  This Columbia variety is one of my favorites.  It's not as bold as the Italian or French Roast varieties, but it has a smoother and mellower taste and will appeal to those who like a well-balanced cup of coffee.  Good work, Starbucks, and keep the new varieties coming!"
456,B000G6RYNE,Excellent Thai-flavored chip,"I was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store, Lunds, but they were on sale, so I bought a bag.  I've found that going beyond the simply-flavored chips, like cheddar or vinegar, usually results in disappointment.  Tried the Thai or asian-inspired chips by Target, Archer Farms, and they were awful.  These Kettle Spicy Thai chips are just awesome...so much so, that I'm considering buying them in bulk from Amazon.  The taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate.  The taste sensations prevalent in real Thai food is baked into this chip...sweet, salty, spicy.  Was sour in there too?  I don't know, but this is a well-made well-balanced chip that is addicting."

6737,B001LG945O,"Pleasing Orange Soda, A Tad Pricy but worth it","Switch Orange/Tangerine soda comes in a smaller can than a regular soda (a little over 8 ounces, compared to the usual 12 ounces in a regular soft drink can).  It is labeled as ""all-natural"" because the sugars in it come from fruit juices rather than added corn syrup.  I chilled the can of Switch in my refrigerator overnight, and then sampled it poured over ice in a glass.  The color is not so ""neon"" orange as some orange sodas -- it is a softer orange color.  The fizz is also less than in a regular soft drink.<br /><br />I found the flavor pleasing, with none of the chemical or metallic taste which can occur in many brands of orange soda.  The soft fizziness of the drink complemented the orange flavor well.  I didn't really get a true tangerine taste from the soda.  Tangerines are a very acidic fruit, and have a very distinct taste, which I did not really get from this soda.  However, the taste is very smooth and quite refreshing.  My teenaged daughters and their friends loved this soda, and I have been re-ordering it every so often as a treat.<br /><br /> Switch is a bit pricy.  You can cut down on the price by signing up for regular deliveries, but so far I haven't given in to that temptation.  However I am buying it for special occasions, for the travel cooler, and for planned teen get-togethers."
67822,B000G6MBUA,Maybe the worst chips ever.,"These are perhaps the worst chips that have ever gone into my mouth.<br /><br />For my entire life Sour Cream & Onion (and in this case ""& Chive"") chips were my favorite. Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.<br /><br />I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them. Hopefully they'll reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips."
1605,B001RVFDOO,Excellent chips,"Just to give a little background - I ordered these because they were a great deal for a box of single serving chips and I thought I would give them a try.  The variety of flavors in this package was great and I enjoy most of them.  These chips leave a lot less mess than your average bags of potato chips and there are very few crumbs in the bag.  It is apparent these are not prepared like normal chips and the result is a differently textured chip.  It will be a personal taste as to whether or not you will like the taste and texture, but, I would highly recommend trying these out."

6607,B002BRC562,Great tasting with help keeping energy up.,"I was excited to try these little honey chews to help with my energy levels during exercising and running.  I am 60 years old and about 50 pounds overweight.  I find it hard to keep my energy up day after day while running and exercising.  First of all these are so tasty without being overly sugary.  I was surprised though to see that the ingredients weren't mostly honey and the first ingredient listed which is suppose to be what the item has the most of is tapioca syrup.  I guess with the package calling it honey stinger I was thinking that it was pure honey with some taste enhancers.  Still, everything is organic which I suppose should add to it's value.  I found that I felt no energy boost during my activities but I can say that without a doubt that these make you feel like you can keep going and going.  It's not something that feels like you are really energetic but more like you just got a good days rest and are ready to get going.  I don't like feeling like I'm on a sugar high with that nervous feeling in my chest and these do not do that.  I think they make you feel healthy and are a good addition to your diet for exercising.  The only drawback to me is the cost of these $16 for 12 bags makes it hard to justify the purchase as often as you would like to have them.  I will purchase again when my grocery money allows.  I would recommend to buy if you are looking for a healthy pickup to keep you going all day and not just for a quick boost."

68635,B0019CSQ36,Occasionally moldy but otherwise good,"We used to buy the canisters of these until they disappeared from retail stores.  They were addicting but later became hit-and-miss.  Some was tender and fresh, while some was too stale or smoky-tasting and would get left unfinished.  The expiration dates were at least 6 months ahead, so that wasn't the problem.<br /><br />Anyway, we recently ordered the bags and were pleasantly surprised.  They're not quite as tender and tasty as the first canisters we opened years ago, but they're worth the price.  The only problem we've had is that out of 6 shipments and 72 bags, 4 bags contained mold -- from 3 different shipments.  Three bags had just a couple spots of mold but were a little stale and tasted funny.  The fourth bag had about half the surface area of the jerky covered in white mold, and the smell was pretty bad.  We're still eating more but checking for mold first -- not something we should have to do.<br /><br />As someone else mentioned, the Amazon's product photo and nutrition information are old.  The bag now advertises 16 grams of protein, not 21.  Fat content is increased from 10 g to 14."
26405,B001JYVT60,NOT long lasting,"I was very disappointed by the product.  They are NOT long lasting as I was lead to believe.

He does enjoy them though."

6578,B002BRC562,The best of the energy chews!,"I'm a runner doing 30-50 miles a week and am currently (9/10) training for the Chicago Marathon.  I've tried all of the gels and chews that are out there and these are my favorite.  I don't like gels as that squirt of mush activates my gag reflex.  Plus you always need water with them.  I've tried all of the other brands of energy chews (I think); Sharkies (good but sticky and not very tasty), Clif Shot Bloks (nice package, very sticky on the fingers), GU Chomps (super sticky and caused some nausea), PowerBar Gel Blasts (very good but tough to chew if cold).  The Honey Stinger chews are very easy to chew and you don't need water.  They don't stick to your teeth either.  The main selling point for me is that they taste good and don't cause nausea no matter what.  I'm sticking with these ones."

33971,B00412W76S,Not bad,"What can I say?  It's herbal tea, it tastes a bit grassy, but I like it.  I'd say try some before you buy a bunch of it because people either seem to love it or hate it."
9292,B006N3IG4K,Misleading Flavor Name,"As coffee in general, this Wolfgang variety was alright. However, I was expecting a ""Creme Caramel"" taste, or something similar, and I don't feel this delivered. I tried multiple cups at different cup sizes and this coffee just didn't do it for me. It is marketed as a flavored coffee, yet I could not taste anything beyond the flavor of coffee."
2788,B000J2DQ46,Not very good,"My local store had the product lineon close-out at 77 cents a can so I bought a dozen cans of different verities. Lobster soup was very fishy for starters and the Manhattan chowder was very watered down.  The New England chowder is somehow creamy and void of flavor.  The Clam corn chowder was not enjoyable.<br /><br />  I am real soup eater and take soup at least once a day and always when I dine out.  Long story short... This is the most tasteless soup and just not good.  I suggest you pass on this and I am sure Cambells will be a much better choice than these soups... Sorry, I had leave an unfavorable review bit this soup is just not worth eating and 77 cents a can I would never buy this again"

6420,B002YD0AFQ,Very Disappointed,"Claxton Dark Fruitcake has been a holiday tradition in our family since the mid 1950's. I ordered it directly from the company this year and when I served it at Thanksgiving, my guests and I thought I must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell Claxton fruitcakes.  It was at best 40% fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored ""cake"".  I emailed the company and expressed my disappointment.  After several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners, they assured me that it was the original dark recipe.<br /><br />In reading the ingredients, I noticed that corn syrup, sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the 4th ingredient.  At the very end were listed molasses, spices and 3 artificial food dyes.  High fructose corn syrup wasn't widely available until the mid 1970's to mid 1980's, so I'm not sure how it was one of the original ingredients.<br /><br />All of the people I talked to seemed to have the attitude that I was so stupid that I couldn't possibly be observing what I had correctly. Although they offered to send replacements if I returned it at my own expense, they told me that what I would receive would be identical to what I have.  One of the owners informed me that they had received zero complaints this year.<br /><br />I am grieving the loss of an almost 55 year tradition, but the other 4 cakes are now in the trash."

23096,B004ZIER34,Good flavor but hard to judge any acid difference,"I made this coffee and shared it with people in my office.  The consensus opinion was that it has the flavor found in many other brands identified as french roast, but is not as overpowering as brands like Starbucks.  It was difficult to judge the lower acidity.  I usually drink decaf, partially due to acidity issues, and reacted about the same to the Puroast Low Acid as I do to most decafs."

No more brushing needed and their coats are very soft and shiny.  We have used other grain free foods previously and liked them but this one is definitely the best we have tried.  It's pricey but we are able to feed them 1/2 of what we were using on the other foods and still maintain the same weight.  This food is well worth the price and the dogs love it.

I gave one to her whole at first and she ignored it. I thought the treat may be too big for her since they were a bit bigger than silver dollars so I broke it up and put it in her food dish with some of her food. She basically ate all her food but ignored the pieces of the treat.<br /><br />I do like that there is nothing artificial in these treats. The box states that what is contained in the treats include: chicken, turkey, turkey liver, turkey heart, pumpkinseeds, apples, carrots, ground chicken bone, butternut squash, ground flaxseeds, montmorillonite clay, broccoli, lettuce, spinach, dried kelp, apple cider, vinegar, parsley, honey, salmon oil, olive oil, mixed tocopherols with citric acid, rosemary, blueberries, alfalfa sprouts, persimmons, inulin, sage, and clove. However, even if it is all natural, if the cat won't eat it, it does me no good.<br /><br />I know all cats and dogs are different so some will like the treats. However for me, I will not be buying these in the future."

I find it better to cut the plastic open with scissors to avoid breaking the cookies.<br /><br />If you want the cookies crumbled, just break them up in the packaging and then cut open with scissors to dispense neatly.<br /><br />I like to cut up strawberries and crumble a Nana's cookie over them.  With a little whipped cream, it's just like a good strawberry shortcake.  They are great crumbled over bananas, too.<br /><br />Despite being somewhat fragile.  Nana's cookies from Amazon usually arrive intact."

It tastes great, sure, but in the first few bites, it falls apart, losing any cohesiveness (gummyness), and just gets swallowed. For some reason, about 1/3 of it remains intact and becomes gum. What little remains is as the other reviewers state, but knowing that I've swallowed more than half the sticks I've chewed is not a pleasant thought."

3403,B005K4Q1VI,"Not bad, but same taste as powder packs at grocery store","I like it ok, but it isn't anything great. I have a hot water tap and it is just as easy for me to make the powder packs at home at a fraction of the cost. I'll go back to that method and save my $$ for coffee."
2471,B002JX7GVM,Definitely Pineapple,"To me, this tastes more like pineapple juice than coconut.  There is an underlying hint of coconut, I know the water isn't strongly flavored, but I wasn't expecting so much pineapple.  This is tangy and sweet.  It is alright.  Package is smaller, but I don't think I could handle too much more of it in one sitting.  I am not thrilled with their unflavored coconut water, it is too tangy/sour to me, so with the pineapple it helps cover up that funkiness for me.  Not sure I'd buy this again.  Still in search of the one I first tried and fell in love with, but so far not finding anything as light and fresh tasting."
6046,B008EE2PNO,Raw Organics going back to Paradise,Raw is eating from your Organic garden of fresh grown fruits and vegetables.It is also all the nuts growing from the mountains that surrounds us through out the land from the forest. Although grown from a tiny little seed that the sun and rain helps in growth it is our heavenly father our creator God who truly makes them grow and should be appreciated for his gift of life to us all and for our home the planet we call earth .<br />I used to be a true vegetarian then I went to only eating Poultry and some fish and eggs through out the years.Now I will eat vegetarian soup made with some beef stock but I don't care for the meat itself and no pork.<br />I am still Organic Alternative and Green but I am slowly trying to go back to being that true vegetarian that I used to be however going raw will take a some time because I have a little hard time chewing with my teeth like my friend but after I get my dentures I will be able to adjust into it .Right now I am canning for winter storage.I have dehydrated my whole garden into green super power food that I added to my barley greens. note if you choose to cook get the Fagor Pressure cooker caner That I got it helps make the meals go quicker and is a lot healthier than baking and Broiling or grilling and never fry food.<br />Well I will let you know how the canning turn out and one day I'd like to make home made all fruit yes that's right not jelly or jam.<br />Hi Again so far so good I have canned 4 pint jars of my home made spaghetti sauce with 4 of Chili and 4 vegetarian soups with 2 red cabbages and they sealed and are ready for winter when things get rough as around here it is hard to get organics so when I do I get all that I can like I just got up at the farmers market this late fall and then I either freeze them or can them and even dehydrate them.<br />So I will keep you up to date but I need to try and get some organic fruits and that is hard to get again around here.<br />well catch ya later as I never say goodbye!Just get this wonderful organic fruit nut and seed mix it has no preservatives and is delicious and affordable and if I can get it you can too. Just remember to soak the nuts and seeds because nature puts some  protective coating on it and they need to break down this to be edible and fit for human consumption.
23643,B005F5ECFY,These people are crazy!,"I have no idea how these people sleep at night!! I pay $1.68 for these mints at Wal-Mart. When I saw these on amazon, for $12 somthing I asumed this price was for a case. This seemed like a money saving deal to me even including shipping. I ordered 2 thinking it was 2 cases and the total was $32 and change. They arived a few days later and it was 2 6OZ BAGS!!!!!!!!!!!! For $32  dollars I got 12 oz of mints! How in the hell can they screw people like this and live with themselves? Who would pay over $12 for 6 oz of peppermints??? My dumb ass I guess, but it wont happen again because I won't be buying anything else, ever again from these theives. I suggest you dont either!!!!!!!!!!"
22916,B004ZIER34,Worst Cup of Coffee Ever,"This coffee may be low acid, but it leaves such an awful after-taste - like you're drinking burnt coffee grounds. This coffee was so bad that I poured it out and made a fresh pot of what we've been drinking. World of difference!"
5071,B005H3BYHI,Love this stuff!!,"This brand is a little hard to find in stores as i don't think it's carried by any of the major supermarket chains. I discovered it at Au Bon Pain and noticed that unlike other brands I've tried, this one is not from concentrate and has nothing added, it's just pure unadultered coconut water, so the quality can't get much better. The other thing i really like about it is that it's a glass container rather than paper or plastic, so the taste is not compromised. These things alone are worth 5 stars to me but there are a couple things I would suggest to make it even better. First, this isn't really pulp the way you would think of it from you experience with fruit juices where there's pulverized, very small, drinkable pieces floating in the liquid; these are chunks of diced coconut that you have to chew up while drinking. To me, this would be fine if they were all the soft flesh you'd expect from a young cocunut but many of the pieces are harder which is unpleasant in a drink. Second, 9.5 ounces doesn't go a long way, I'd like to see it bumped up to at least a 12oz, I'd then feel like I'm getting an adequate amount for my money and it would last longer and quench better."
915,B000ER6YO0,Runny and odd-tasting,"My triplets will not eat this, eventhe one who will eat ANYTHING. The consistency is way too runny as well and does not stay on the spoon."

69954,B00032BG3K,THREE TIMES THE PRICE OF WALMART,GOOD PRODUCT BUT THIS COMPANY IS RIPPING OFF CUSTOMERS.  GO TO YOUR LOCAL WALMART OR PUBLIX AND GET IT FOR LESS THAN HALF THIS OUTRAGEOUS PRICE.
26629,B000YSS7EO,Rancid Smell and Taste,"I purchased this cereal because it appeared to be very healthy and promising. But once I received it and after smelling and tasting it i knew something was wrong. I know a rancid smell when i smell it. I would not feed this to my baby. I tasted and it left a terrible after taste. I called the company and read other reviews on this defect. The company says since there is less fat in this specific product, a smell has resulted but it does not affect the overall product and is safe to eat. I was sent another container but this had the same smell, so I would conclude that the recently made containers are all like this. The expiration date was in 2013. Sorry, but anything that smells like this I would never give to my baby. However the oat and rice cereals do not have a rancid smell and I give those to my baby every day and do not see a problem with them. I still need to research more into the extraction method of DHA which may also have something to do with the smell."
7451,B007NVJ4CY,Tastes like tea,This is an awful coffee. The flavor is extremely weak and tastes more like a lemon grass tea than coffee.
8847,B002SRUYL8,Mediocre,Not quiet what I was expecting.  The cherries were dried and could not taste the brandy.  The dark chocolate was good but too crunchy.
1236,B000K296BW,What?  No ingredient list?,Where's the ingredient list for this product?  Thought all foods were supposed to have it.  Would never buy any food without first knowing what's in it!

24818,B004JQTAKW,The Worst Coffee I've had in 50 Years!,"I've drunk a lot of coffee in the last fifty years and this is the absolute worst ever! Nothing I've had ever had comes close to how awful this stuff is. This has no taste and is very bitter, actually it does tastes worse than some mud I've eaten as a young child. What a waste of money,as I am not allowed to return the unopened bags, all three will go into the trash! When I say I'm pretty disappointed in this purchase I'm being kind.<br />Don't buy this or you will be 'bitterly' disappointed!"
434457,B0037YXQSY,Well worth the price on Amazon!,"The Instant Breakfast variety pack price cannot be beat because you do not pay tax! With a ""Prime"" membership, you also get this in two days!"
431843,B000FFRY5O,please watch out!,I just received these pretzels but have not tasted them yet because I noticed under the ingredients on the package that it says may contain traces of sesame or poppy seeds.  My son is allergic to sesame seeds and this was not stated on the website under ingredients.  I notified Amazon and they will look into this.

1690,B001RVFDOO,YUM!,I found these chips on vacation in Oregon.  The store was a kind of natural yet upscale type of grocery store.  I had never seen them before.  They are different than regular chips-no oily taste but very flavorful.  I didn't know if I could get them in CA so I ordered a case!
4812,B00139TT72,Great Dog Food!,"Our dog LOVES this food!  He was having serious gastrointestinal problems that weren't clearing up -- until we started him on Newman's Own.  Since then, he has been regular, happy, and healthy."
675,B000G6MBX2,That's a spicy!,"If you've tried the conventional Kettle crinkle chip verson Salt and Peper, you CAN'T compare these to those!  These are easily some of the most spicy chips you will ever eat, but oompletely enjoyable.  You finish the bag and the indside is just coated with spices.  Great stuff."

8529,B003VXFK44,"Great, smooth-tasting coffee!","Sometimes we have a problem ordering the k-cups because they are way too strong for us--even if you order medium blend.  This coffee was great--just right!  It was a smooth blend, and was perfect for a morning cup of coffee--or anytime!  Would definitely order again!"

34306,B001P3NU30,SEVERE VOMITING,"I have two dogs and both react very badly to these.  The two times my Labrador got one she vomited severely both times.  The other dog reacted by urinating and pooping in the house...VERY unusual for her to do either of these chores in the house.  Both dogs reacted within twenty minutes of ingesting these chews.  I have thrown them out and am writing a review, which is something I seldom do unless it's positive.  My advice:  don't take the chance with these, there are other alternatives.  For any pet owner who gives their dog(s) chews of any sort please google the method for giving your dog the heimlich maneuver in case the dog chokes...there's an easy way to perform this on a dog."

Helps me get calcium cause I need to add a tiny bit more milk due to the slight thickening (I use almond milk) ... You can add this Gelatin to any liquid or creamy COLD stuff to add protein ... My skin & fingernails have turned lovely ...

68896,B001EQ5OSM,Holy Grapes!!!!,"These are NOT CURRANTS.....These are a variety of grapes and I demand that they SHOULD be renamed ""Raisins"".  By no means, these are currants.  I was on a ""Currant Hunt"" since Jamie Oliver's recipe for summer fruit pudding.  I could not get fresh currants (beg, borrow, steal....Sigh...no luck).  So, the last resort was for dry currants (if not fresh, I thought I could atleast use rehydrated dry currants as substitute).  After about 2 months of search, I found a few packs of these at my local Kroger.  I should have read the description.  It was my fault.  These are a variety of grapes that are usually called ""Zante Currants"".  THAT'S IT.  Absolutely not related to currants.  My teacher Google taught me the lesson about these grapes.  Why is it so difficult here in the USA to find even the dry currants?<br /><br />These are VERY GOOD FOR RAISINS though."
50002,B00430B73W,"Little coconut, lots of dates, minimal nuts",I did not think coconut and dark chocolate could ever taste bad.<br />I was expecting mainly those 2 ingredients. I was wrong. It's mostly a date flavor and texture with a sprinkle of coconut and a thin chocolate coating. I did not taste cashews or almonds at all. Maybe the folks that are rating these bars highly have acquired a taste for such items.
8376,B003VXFK44,Hated it!,"Didn't realize it was flavored and thought, when I had my first sip, that it tasted like chemicals. F-. Gave it away the next day at work."
1890,B001RVFDOO,Snack of the hour!,"These are such a treat when you are craving that salty, crunchy snack. And the multi-box where you get a variety of flavors is perfect. Share it with son so they don't get stale but not much chance of that.  One of my ""3 Points plus"" Weight Watchers Snacks that I don't run out of!"
69808,B004138SWO,awful...,"A terrible disappointment. The fruit was slightly hard and flavorless. Only the apricots were edible. It was so bad that I threw the second tray away, not wanting to give it to anyone as a gift.  If only the fruit were like that in the picture."
3673,B000FDKQC4,Good and GLUTEN FREE,"Folks who are comparing this to Hodgson's blueberry muffin mix obviously don't require gluten-free products (since the blueberry are whole wheat muffins). If, like me, you require gluten free, this is a great product. This is the first flavorful GF baked good I have stumbled upon. Very simple and quick to make. Like all GF products, they are pretty dense in the end, but the apples make for a nice addition and they fill you up. Personally, I added a bit more ""sugar"" (xylitol) than the recipe calls for. Next batch, I will also add some fresh apples and extra cinnamon. My only complaint is that you get so little out of the box (makes 6 small muffins)."
269219,B003S9GWU2,Smells like real food,My two cat enoy this canned food.  They come running as I get it out of the cabinet.  I recommend this canned cat food.
27577,B000FK52B2,Sprout Master,"The biggest disadvantage to the sprout master is that i found it difficult to get rid of the hulls - it seems  to be much easier with a jar and screens. However, the sprouts seem to store well in the sprout master - they stay fresh a long time."
46725,B000RI3SKY,Pill Pockets - You'll Like Them,"Designed to insert a pet's pill in the pocket. Squeeze or pinch the top of the pocket over and the pill is concealed from a pet in a treat. In fact, the treat is so soft and supple, you don't even have to put the pill in the pocket. You can just push the treat onto the pill and squeeze the rest of the treat material around the pill to hide it. Works well when hiding multiple pills that might not fit in the pocket. I buy the cat size for my small dog (4.5 lb), and she just loves them. Never has refused a pill hidden in one. I even use them empty as a treat!"
18913,B003SC0Q4C,not good in the summer,"We LOVED this product until shipments starting arriving in June--in Texas.  The taste is terrible!  No ginger taste left, not happy with the product at all any more.  Sad...loved it back in the winter and spring.  Guess it can't survive the heat in travel."
63664,B002IEZJMA,50 Calories But Does Not Have Much Bite,"My standard of reference for canned espresso is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018BZODI"">Starbucks DoubleShot Espresso Drink, 12 - 6.5 Oz. Cans</a> and this espresso does not have the bite of DoubleShot. But it has only 50 calories. So you compromise flavour for low calories."
392543,B000U9V59G,Rum Flavor Extract,Was a gift - could only find dinky bottles at local stores.  according to giftee item is required fruit cake.
128513,B007L3NVKU,Incorrectly Advertised,The 80 count pack is incorrectly advertised as costing .01 per count...That would make the package cost 80 cents...not close to 50 dollars

28564,B0089SPEO2,Yummy hot or cold!!,Just like making it from the tea bag.  Yummy hot or cold!  Wish all the Zinger flavors were available as a K-cup.
64016,B000NHYNNU,Impressive,"I never rate things on here but I had to make an exception for this tea. Usually any hot drink will alleviate some discomfort in a sore throat, but this throat coat tea goes above and beyond that. No matter if it's a sore throat from sinus drainage, a cold, or whatever else, this tea has always cleared up all the itchy, scratchy, and painful problems I've had for at least a couple of hours at a time. That's more than a lot of medicine is able to do."
196165,B004TVRUX6,Scam!,This stuff has absolutely zero olive oil taste or smell. I might as well have bought bottles of Wesson for 1/4 the price. Don't waste your money.
499508,B000CQID6U,Ahhh finally truly spicy chai in a tea bag,"I once had a soy chai latte that blew my mind. I was driving through Missoula Montana. I have yearned for years to capture that taste again. I have tried chai after chai with no luck. This chai comes close. If you like spicey chai but without all the sugar and milk in the premixed, this may be your chai."
19525,B000084ETV,Canidae - Still the best,"I've been feeding my two labradors this food for about 3 yrs now and they are both doing well.<br />My older lab (13yrs.) seems to thrive on it and despite some level of arthritis in her hips, she still is very active. I don't mean to ascribe this to Canidae soley, but it certainly helps."
38017,B0000CERZK,A little lacking,"I love sunflower seeds, chocolate, and cherries, so you can imagine my delight when I found these Chocolate Cherry Sunflower Seeds available on Amazon.  When the packet arrived, I tore it open and downed the entire contents into my eager mouth, expecting an explosion of chocolate-cherry-sunflowery sapidity.  Instead, I got a mouthful of hard shells.  I crunched through the tough, outer hulls, wondering at the inventiveness of the manufacturers who had somehow injected chocolate and cherry flavors into hard, unopened shells, but then as I macerated both hull and softer kernel into a splintery mash, found that the chocolate and cherry flavors had somehow gone missing.<br /><br />When my wife came home, I mentioned to her how I was ripped off by the Chocolate Cherry Sunflower Seeds which lacked both chocolate and cherry flavors and, in fact, were barely edible.  My wife picked up the empty packet, looked at it for a moment, and then hit me over the head with a dining room chair.  ""You idiot,"" she said, ""these seeds are for planting.""  She then clobbered me with an antique, oak coat tree.  ""I don't know why I ever married you,"" she continued, ""you are always doing stupid, embarrassing things, and no matter how hard I hit you, you never learn.""  She then whacked me with the coffee table for emphasis.<br /><br />Maybe I had gotten a bad batch of seeds.  I think I will order them again, and the next time, the manufacturers had better not forget the chocolate and cherry flavors, or someone is going to get a beating!"
4677,B000FBM4FI,DANGER!,"DON'T YOU KNOW THAT SUGAR IS THE SAND OF TIME ?  SINCE THE INGREDIENTS OF KAVLI CRISPY THIN WERE LISTED ON AMAZON, AND THE TIME I RECEIVED MY ORDER,  SUGAR  WAS ADDED TO THIS PRODUCT.  YOU ARE GOING TO GET IN TROUBLE, MISTER."
6473,B000FNEX50,Nana Banana - a delicious gluten-free treat for kids or adults!,"Let me preface this review by saying that in the gluten-free world, baked goods tend to be a bit on the crumbly side because they are missing the ""glue"" (gluten) that holds them together.  Taking this into consideration, Nana's gluten free cookie bars are one of the tastiest gluten-free treats and one of the only brands sweetened with fruit juice instead of sugar.<br /><br />At only 130 calories, 4.5 grams of fat, and 7 grams of sugar (natural fruit sugar), the Nana Banana flavor of cookie bars makes a great treat for kids and adults.  The amount of banana is just right, and you even get a few tiny bits of crunchy banana inside.<br /><br />Each cookie measures approximately 3.5 inches long by 1.5 inches wide...perfect for a light snack or dessert, especially for kids.  Amazon has the best price around on Nana's Cookie Bars, so rest assured that you are getting a good deal, even though they are pricier than ""regular"" cookies made with corn syrup and sugar.<br /><br />Good cookies aren't cheap, and cheap cookies aren't good!  Give Nana's banana cookies a try.  (No, I don't work for Nana's but am a happy, loyal customer!)"

31124,B007M83302,Love These Chips!!!!,Purchased these by the case since they are so hard to find in my local store.  Also enlisted in the auto delivery program.  The only problem is by purchasing them 12 at a time - they are always in the house and tempting me.  Will never go back to regular chips again.
248221,B00474ELW8,This is a 10% blend! Says so on the bag but you must display and zoom to see and read. Shame on Amazon!,This is a 10% blend! Says so on the bag (gourmet blend and that is a 10% Kona bean blend)but you must display and zoom to see and read. Shame on Amazon! Just reading the Amazon page there is nothing that says blend and that is deceptive. There is a law in Hawaii against practice like this.
253826,B0050BW4I0,Change in treats,"My dog LOVES these treats, is spoiled, and gets one at bedtime daily. However, I have noticed that within the last few months the treats are getting smaller and smaller. They are advertised as being 10-12 inches long. In the last 2 shipments I have about 1/3 to 1/2 of the case of treats as small as 6-7 inches. They cost the same. Has anyone else noticed this? I love Merrick and do not want to see their commitment to quality suffer."

13386,B001BSBFUO,These pill pockets literally saved our dog's life,"I was so relieved when I found this product. Our doberman was having serious skin allergies and had to take antibiotics and steroids in pill form. He was so crafty with the pills - we would hide them in wet dog food, only to find the food eaten and the pills spit out. We hid them in salami, raw meat, pastrami, turkey, soft cheese, hard boiled egg, anything that you could think of that is appetizing to a dog and he would eat the food and spit out the pills. It got so bad that he actually stopped eating and drinking. He was so sick. Our vet put him on IV fluids and steroids and antibiotics and these wreaked havoc on his liver. We were so worried. He was going down the drain. Then I found this product. Simple as that, we put the medicine in the treat and he wolfed it down. He actually got to the point that when the 6 hour time was coming around to ""get the treat"" he would start whining and staring at the refrigerator where I had prepared the whole dosage plan ahead of time and put them into a plastic box with big lettering, ""THIS IS ALEX'S MEDICINE - NOT CHOCOLATE!"" We had a close call with my little sister - they looked appetizing to her as well! :) Now I use these for his vitamins and for anything that he has to take that is not appetizing. Really a life saver!"

7578,B000ELWDR8,Delicious!,"Months ago I had my first butternut squash soup, hand made at a fancy restaurant. I do not like canned soups... but I saw this in our local grocers, and remembering the soup I had at the restaurant, I decided to try it. It was delicious! It is my favorite lunch go-to now. I have added shredded roasted turkey to make it heartier, but as for taste it is wonderful. I order the case on Amazon, which is cheaper than my local store. I also tried their french onion soup which is really good. I have avoided the others simply because in their best form, I don't like chicken noodles and tomato soups, but for the 2 I do like and have tried, they really made something from canned soups, and I'd recommend them."

6396,B000084EK6,Great food!,"This is another favorite in our house.  My cat doesn't want it more than 4 times a month or so, but he still wants it and licks the bowl clean.  It is fish, not his favorite, but he really likes his salmon and this one is outstanding.  It's ground (why don't they make a sliced or bits version?), not his favorite either, but he does get it down pretty quickly.  Try this one - it's a definite winner."
1135,B002OHOC6A,Cat Digs It!,"I used to buy this at Target but it's cheaper at Amazon.<br /><br />My cat goes crazy when I get out the bag so I know she loves it. Cheap to boot, also!<br /><br />I don't really stress out about which exact ingredients are in cat or dog food. I figure it's all pretty decent so why not save a little money..."
4133,B001EW5YQS,A tad bit noisy and cheaply made,"Never really intended to use this in a professional setting so the noise issue is not that big of a deal. Just wanted a simple device that could fit in my backpack to interface with my laptop for impromptu interviews and music recordings. For the price paid, it's very cheap and lightweight plastic construction leaves much to be desired. Overall, I can not recommend this product at the current price it's sold at. 15 to 20 dollars, then sure. Still, it's an OK product."

2496,B001EO6AWS,IT'S OK FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT,"It doesn't have a whole lot of flavor, but most light roasts don't.  It does have a unique flavor, but is kind of rich and tiring, so I recommend you mix it with other coffees to make it taste better and make you other bland coffees taste a little better."
63735,B002IEZJMA,Too Bitter and It Had Sugar In It,"This coffee is way too bitter.  It also has sugar, which I despise sugar in my coffee.  When I saw it had sugar it in, I chilled it (got it really ice-cold) before I tried it, so that I could give it a shadow of a chance.  But even though it was chilled, it was still too bitter and sweet.<br /><br />Perhaps if there were no sugar in it, I might could have gotten over the bitterness and gave it a few more stars, even if I couldn't have given it 5 stars.<br /><br />But it was absolutely horrible.  Never again.  (And I do love coffee.)"
295235,B000A0OG5K,no info on product quantity,I can buy 1 quart of this product locally for $19.00 how much do I get for the $100.00 asking price this ad is very uninformative actually it is amateurish. Had to give this product a rating to post but should get no stars as ad has no needed info
35434,B001HWWLHA,Delicious!,"I absolutely love this tea.  It's great on a chilly morning; personally, I prefer it to coffee.  It's not overly sweet so as a southern girl, I always add a little sugar to it.  Give it a try.  You won't be disappointed!"
6270,B000KOSDY6,"Tasty, Unique Treat","I grew up in Southern California, so I've had my share of sweet corn cakes at local restaurants. This mix is a great way to make these at home.

1165,B004IF3TAQ,Not nearly as good as Bissinger's French Long,"After searching for a more constant and less expensive supply of ""real"" licorice over my favorite (more about that later), I decided to try this one based upon other reviews and the description. I have to say that I was disappointed. It is not intense enough and a bit too salty for my preference since all that I noticed was salt and more salt until it got down to the licorice flavor which I would charactize as ""modest"". My all time favorite licorice was discovered years ago while visiting a St. Louis mall has been and remains an excellent choice made by Bissinger's Chocolate Company and they call it French Long Licorice. It is not noticeably salty and packed with flavor without being a sicky-sweet candy. I say that and caution licorice lovers to know their favorite ""type"" of licorice; this is important when reading reviews and purchasing. I was looking for something not American-style junk candy, with actual licorice extract not anise, chewy, lasting, with true strong licorice flavor and no other flavor overtones.<br /><br />As far a Bissinger's is concerned, they do not make this licorice year round nor advertise it on their website or in their catalogs so you have to call their toll free number and ask if it has been in production. It is expensive but well worth it for excellent flavor and lasting ability (I can enjoy one for at least 15 minutes if I don't chew). These are my favorite thing to have when reading a great book and I limit myself to 2 at a sitting for my ""fix""; okay, sometimes 3 if it is a superb book:D.<br />The last time I ordered it they were generous and added a pound of their premium chocolate as a thank-you for being a customer that troubled to find their particular product because I do not live near one of their stores and unless I visit say St. Louis (where it is headquartered) I have to mail-order.Anyway, I prefer my licorice hard and let it soften in my mouth so when I get an order ($56 for 2lbs) I leave it out lightly wrapped for a few days to harden off. That makes it last longer in my mouth and does not affect flavor but that it personal mouth feel preference. It frezes without problems so I will just have to go back to that and pay for my pleasure and stock up :). Licorice-gotta have it!"
554493,B001E5E0DI,Lavazza coffee,I bought this coffee for my husband who loves his expresso machine.  He gave it rave reviews and he can't wait for our next shipment.
455969,B001AHI2HA,Very tasty and fast cook!,"Pros: tasty, cooks in microwave 3 minutes and healthy<br />Cons: priced at $5 for 1 pound."

5486,B00622CYVI,Earths Best...is THE BEST !!,"I was reading the other day about which items you shoud buy organic<br />and fruits and vegtables were the top of the list. So dahh..it dawns<br />on me what have I been feeding my baby ?

8986,B0007A0AP8,Dorkie want a treat,Well my dog seems to like these very much.  Let's see if someone can offer free shipping on these.
8692,B003VXFK44,Exquisitely Flavored Medium Coffee,"I tried this coffee on a half dozen quests this weekend and they all loved it.  For those that like their coffee mild, I brewed 7 oz cups.  For those of us that like it bold, I brewed 5 oz cups.<br /><br />As an earlier posted noted, it does have a slightly flavored quality to the taste that makes it stand out from other coffees.  The taste isn't obvious enough to turn off drinkers who want their coffee ""regular and black"" but strong enough to note for those of us that pay attention.<br /><br />I plan on trying all of Wolfgang's line.  Wish he'd offer a variety pack."
50083,B001P2WTRO,Not worth $10,"BAD BUY.  I put this item on my baby registry thinking it was the size of a tub you could actually bath a baby in but when I received it, it is the size of small cantaloupe.  The products inside the tiny tub are dollar store quality (not to mention some were damaged)<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P2WTRO"">Bath Time Baby Gift Basket -Medium</a> and I would NOT recommend anyone purchasing.  Also, Amazon will not refund and when I call the number Amazon gave me, you have to leave a message for them to get back to you.  There is no live person you are able to communicate with.  Smells FISHY to me!"
3336,B005K4Q1VI,Not good,"Thin, runny, and the fake milk powder used to add ""creaminess"" has an off flavor. Better off eating your ceramic mug."
5236,B0012YEKCW,Easy to grow and good for your cat!,"Cat Grass is not only a treat that cats love to eat, it is also good for them and will help deter them away from eating houseplants!  My cat often nibbles on houseplants then throws up and I'm always afraid that it will do damage to her digestive system.  When there is cat grass around, though, she only eats that - she really chows it down, and it makes her happy, too!  Cat grass is also good for cats - it contains vitamins that may or may not be present in cat food, and it aids their digestive system and helps to eliminate fur balls.<br /><br />Even if you do not have a green thumb, cat grass is so easy to grow, that anyone can do it and it's also a great ""project"" for kids, too.  The seeds sprout very quickly (if you keep them moist) and will grow quickly to 4-6inches in a window sill.<br /><br />If you have cats, cat grass is a must!"
2025,B001E5E29A,Great Waffle Mix,This mix makes great tasting waffles.  A little extra work and expense but worth it.  Need to stretch the recipe a little bit to make 2 full waffles on my new Presto Flipside Belgian Waffle Maker.
2789,B000J2DQ46,Nothing Special,"I expected better from a premium Maine chowder. This is no better than, say, Snow's, which you can get for less than half the price. Not bad, but not worth the money."
2925,B000F9Z1WI,Oreo flavored crackers without the creme filling,"These are great snacks for traveling, such as, by airplane or car.  The cookie comes in the shape of a small cracker.  The cracker is less messy than a cookie which can break apart and crumble; and for this reason a preferred treat.<br /><br />The texture is comparable to a medium crunchy chip and very light to eat.  The first response by most people when eating the cracker for the first time is, ""Humm these are good!""  This is a pleasant response and these crackers will probably be a big success over time."
3888,B000GEVGXA,"Truffle Oil? Well, at least the oil is real.","I'm flabbergasted by the glowing reviews that ""truffle oil"" is receiving on Amazon! Those of you espousing a desire to drizzle this stuff on your food might be sorely disappointed to learn that the truffle flavor in those tiny $17 bottles of ""truffle oil"" are made in a laboratory. There's not a molecule of actual truffle in them. It's a sinful shame that's perpetuated despite being outed a few years ago in an enlightening New York Times article called ""Hocus-Pocus, and a Beaker of Truffles."" Read it and weep: [...]<br /><br />And if you see ""truffle oil"" advertised on the menu somewhere, you might ask if they're using any other artificial flavorings in their dishes..."
366345,B005MER0RA,Great product,"This salt has a lot of benefits, using as sole drink and cooking. I'm recommending this to my mother for her psoriasis."
1465,B0040WHJQM,Yum!,These are super tastey! I would definitely recommend. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I wish they were bigger! :D
21485,B002QWP89S,dog treat,My vet told me to have my dog get these to help with her teeth and she loves them
3983,B001P1Y79S,Great!,These cashews are the best I've ever had and the containers they come in are the perfect size.
67154,B002DZGI24,Awesome GFCF chocolate bars!,Having a child on a GFCF diet has made it very difficult to locate foods to help make her feel like she's included when other kids are eating or there's a party in school.  This item helps do just that!<br />Great texture and flavor...I highly recommend!
6845,B001LG945O,A solid juice offering,"You know what one of my favorite sounds is? The sound of a can opening. I think it's weird, consider I'm not a huge soda drinker...since I find most sodas too be way too sweet or sugary.<br /><br />This is a review for an Orange Tangerine drink from Switch. I've never heard of them, but I was feeling kind of thirsty so I ordered a can from the vine program. It's an 8.3 ounce can of 100% carbonated juice (plus gum acacia, natural flavors and colors, ascborbic acid and soy). I don't know what to think about some of the ingredients, but I certainly do know that I like: that it's only 8 ounces and that it has no corn syrup!<br /><br />It tastes very similar to canned Minute Maid drinks, especially the Vallencia Orange offering...but does have a slightly sickly sweet aftertaste.  I don't know if I'd run out and buy a 24 pack, but if I saw this in a restaurant I'd definitely consider it as a tasty complement to a sandwich and potato chip lunch.<br /><br />The last thing I like is about the company: it seems to be an independently owned shop, and I like that."
9042,B006N3IG4K,Our favorite k-cup yet,"We were given a Keurig for a wedding present, along with several variety packs. So far, Wolfgang Puck's Jamaica Me Crazy is our favorite, and we will definitely be repeat buyers of this flavor."
594,B000G6RYNE,"Kettle Chips, Sea Salt","There is nothing too good or too bad about these chips. If you like plain potato chips, you'd like these. They are thicker than most brands, fresh out of box, very crunchy and not too salty (for me). One bag has a lot, I generally cannot finish it by myself. Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice, except salt, as the name says. I don't think I'll buy these again. The ""best by"" date on my bags are March 2011 and I ordered them at the end of October."
18484,B000BZ6LXO,Deadly if you fertilze,"This soil is unpredictable, except that it's definitely deadly if you add fertilizer during the first two months.  By unpredictable, I mean even without adding fertilizer, it may burn your plants due to hot spots in the soil, where the 6 months of time release nutrients come out all at once.<br /><br />Don't use this on prize garden stock without testing first.  You simply cannot control the nutrient uptake with this potting soil."
64317,B001EO5YAC,Not my mother's Lavazza,"I lived in Italy for several years, and Lavazza was my coffee of choice,  This isn't the same by a long shot -- the roast is anemic, and the resulting espresso is thin and tasteless.  The underlying flavor is has some of the distinctive notes from 'real' lavazza, but that really doesn't compensate for the under-roasting."
79144,B001TEKQ8C,It works.,"I am boarderline anemic, I was told to drink Blackstrap Molasses and I would but hated it. I just find it hard to do. So I was hoping for an alternative, and this product works. My energy is back, I went to donate blood and my count was much higher than it has been. I even have my daughter taking it.<br /><br />Thank you."
451105,B001E5DWZU,EXPIRED!!!!,I bought this item which is a four pack on March the third and it is a four pack which had the expiration date of Jan 2011.. so I now have 4 bottles that are useless and I have been told I can not return per their policy. I want some more.. but obviously some that is NOT out of date!!  Anyone know how to get an exchange on this item??
97738,B001EPQ14E,organic coffee,"no flavor at all, tastes like regular coffee from a grosery,try Jeremiah's Pick Coffee Organic French Roast instead."
215411,B001EO5QPA,Big leaves,I haven't had any problems with this tea so I am a notch above indifferent.  I don't regret buying it.
72120,B00113YQZ0,"Tasty, but if you are sensitive to MSG, I would advise against","I have a sensitivity to MSG. It makes me feel ill and creates digestive issues. I didn't realize that the yeast extract in this product was the equivalent of MSG. After I started using it, I couldn't figure out what was upsetting my system so much, until I eventually put two and two together. They are tasty, but if MSG bothers you, I would not recommend them."
155899,B002G98X70,Durty Santa,This was a gift for a Durty Santa party and was a smash hit.  Every one fought and fought over who got to take it home all night.
70815,B000E4ALGU,These Are *NOT* Soy-Free,"FYI, for those of you on the GFCF diet, these aren't soy-free (if you are watching soy too).<br /><br />They're yummy though!<br /><br />Tori<br />http://gfcfblog.blogspot.com"

268047,B002BC1YFK,hmmm...not what I expected,"I love KC Masterpiece BBQ sauces, but I'm not impressed with this marinade.  Perhaps I'm not sure exactly how to use it...but it's too garilicy for the chicken dishes and seems to have an after taste I'm not fond of...<br /><br />I gave some to a co worker and she liked it, so it could just be me."
7076,B004K30HO2,Almost; but not quite,"We use the K-caps so that we can re-use our K-cups by refilling them with the coffee we like.  We have lost or given away several of the caps over the 2 years that we've been using them; so I thought I would buy some more K-caps.  It turns out, the prices for them have increased substantially; so I went in search of another alternative that would be less expensive.  I found these and thought I had found the answer; but they don't quite work as well as the original K-cups.  They actually caused the Keurig to spew water in directions other than the intended direction and then allowed enough coffee grounds to escape that the holder for the cups became clogged and had to be disassembled and thoroughly cleaned before it could be used again.  Good idea - but not quite right."
2824,B0085G4ACA,Best tasting coconut water I have found!,"I have tried every brand of coconut water that health food stores carry, and this is, by far, my favorite.  The pineapple flavor does not overwhelm the coconut or vice versa. I also like the tetra pack with the screw on top- it is much more convenient than the smaller 11 oz size which you cannot reseal.  This has been a great Gatorade substitute for me, and helps a lot when I am sick or dehydrated or need to hydrate quickly. Great stuff!"
509296,B001397WYY,No Savings,I ordered the cat food online because of the savings and convenience but will not order again because there were 3 damaged cans. It ended up being more expensive than buying in the store.
47876,B004SRH2B6,Never again,"My husband loves coconut water. We were ordering via ""subscribe and save"" the boxes of Zico, but when we saw the bottles of Zico in the store, he wanted to switch because he wanted a larger quantity at one time - he takes them to work and all of his games. He mentioned that it tasted different, but we didn't think much of it. Then, I noticed the ""from concentrate"" after looking at a bottle in the fridge. We are not paying ""top dollar"" for imitation coconut water and the explanation on their website was ridiculous. It is like can OJ! After doing my research on their website, I was angry that they switched the ""liquid"" going into the box vs. bottle. Never again! I immediately canceled our ""subscribe and save"" order. We our going to Henry's this week to purchase a variety of coconut waters and will ""subscribe and save"" to another brand that uses the real stuff!"
5647,B000EUJLHE,Light and Delicious!,"I bought Wasa Crisp'n light crackers at my local supermarket yesterday because they were out of the Wasa rye crackers I usually by - that I really like. This was the last box and I am so happy I bought it!  I love these!  I enjoy most of the crackers by this company, but this is now my absolute favorite and I plan on buying it through Amazon because it is cheaper, I can save time and gas physically shopping and the convenience (Amazon has great customer svc.) is what I appreciate!  By the way, I enjoy these crackers plain and I've eaten them with salmon cooked lightly in olive oil and capers and it was superb!"
2106,B000EPP56U,Excellent non-gluten product,"This is an excellent product for the non-gluten diet.  They're good alone as a snack, or you can make a light meal with them by using these rice crackers as a base for spreads or little crispy sandwiches.  Excellent substitute for crackers containing gluten.  Only criticism - wish the price would come down."
73639,B000EPOC2S,JUST OKAY,Cookies are a little to hard for for me they taste okay but would not buy again sorry that's my review !
33626,B004BPR774,Nothing Like the Cans-Don't Waste Your Time,"I purchased a couple of these for a luau because I was expecting something close to what we get in the cans in Hawaii.  After opening the packet, they smelled really close and this is where the goodness ended.  After adding the water, I took a sip and it was some of the worst stuff that I had ever tasted.  All it really ended up being was colored sugar water and did not taste anything remotely close to the drink in the can.  If you are looking for Hawaiian Sun products, skip this one and go with the cans.  Save yourself the embarrassment of making this for a party and having to take it away.  If I could give this product negative stars, I would."
484367,B00020HHGS,"Don't pay for ""expedited"" delivery","I paid over $13.00 for ""expedited"" delivery and the product still took FIVE days to arrive. Would not buy from them again."
23103,B004ZIER34,It does have the low acid going for it...,...but that is about all.  It appears a lot of taste was sacrificed to achieve the low acid.  I think the reason it is French Roast was to try and add some flavor.  I would rather do without coffee than to drink this.  Not recommended.
80688,B001KU2TZI,expensive,"You can buy this product at costco for 6.00 and that will get you two 48 oz jars, you do the math 9.00 a jar or 3.00 ajar.  Duh 40oz or48oz"
12555,B000FEJ11U,Not like it used to be,Reese changed their Cheesy Popcorn Seasoning.  It is more salt than cheese.  In fact it has very little cheese flavor left.  I will not be purchasing this product again.

435259,B003QNZ4YK,Not K-cups,These are not K-cups which is a shame because there are no Lavazza K-cup option.  I got a refund even though they wouldn't take it back as it is food.
36674,B004CLCEDE,Not What I Was Expecting,"I try to maintain a low carb diet most of the time, and was excited to find these. When I tried them, I thought they were absolutely horrible.  I could get past the smell, it's really not that bad.  I could not get past the fact that I felt like I was eating unflavored gummy worms.  I almost gagged.  I mixed these with alfredo sauce, broccoli, and chicken.  Maybe they would be ok with something that has more of a bold flavor?  Unfortunately, I'm not willing to try them again to find out."
20695,B003ZNXCKE,picture of the package of the dog chew is not what I recieved,"If you open the link to the Smartbones you will see that it shows a picture of a package containing a 3-pack of dog chews.  I did not get this bag, I recieved a single dog chew.  I was under the impression by looking at the description on the bag I was getting a single pkg of 3, Not just 1 dog chew.  This made these quite expensive and I ordered two :-("
3287,B005K4Q1VI,Hot Cocoa K-cups,"I was a little skeptical when I bought this, but it has really been a great purchase.  The cocoa is DELICIOUS!  It's so easy to just make my daughter and I some cocoa quickly before sitting down to watch a movie.  I didn't have to add anything to it, but I did add a tiny bit of milk just to cool it down.  I would definitely recommend this product and purchase it again."
320439,B000E1HVR0,BEST Comfort Food,"This is the tastiest sketti sauce ever made.  I wish someone would copy it and post it somewhere.  The sketti that comes with this box is just a bonus, I buy this for the sauce."

40494,B00020HHRW,"Bad taste, but helps you fall asleep",I bought this to help me fall asleep and it works although it tastes and smell really bad. Make sure to put this in some sort of a glass jar to prevent your kitchen from stinking. I found that if i added cream to this tea it would help the taste but its still pretty bad.
537528,B002X06XE2,Bonsai,I followed the instructions and now I have to wait 15-45 days for it sprout.
3216,B005K4Q1VI,Along these lines,This was the best purchase that I could have made for my daughter. It was priced beautifully and my daughter can study without worrying about the price for her college books. Thanks so much!!
6076,B000H227BG,Not as rich and satisfying as I thought,"Not really sure what I expected, but since I like Ghirardelli chocolate, and I like hot chocolate and hot mochas from coffee shops, I thought I'd like this product.<br /><br />Unfortunately, despite following the directions and making this in milk, it's not as rich and satifying as I hoped.  I hate to say it, but I think Swiss Miss mixed Instant coffee tastes better than this.<br /><br />That's unfortunate, because this is a four pack of cannisters and I'm only half way through the first one!"

42884,B002NHYQAS,Disappointing Dark,"I found this bar rather lacking in chocolate flavor.  At 54%, it might be possible that I am used to a higher cocoa content (60%+).  While some other reviewers have mentioned the mouthfeel as ""grainy"", I found it more chalky.  It melted well in the mouth without any grainy feel, but when chewed, became a rather gummy mass of chocolate.  It wasn't awful by any stretch of the imagination, but it was a little strange.  If you don't like dark chocolate, you would probably enjoy this bar--it seemed more like semi-sweet chocolate to me.  If you like dark chocolate, however, prepare for disappointment."
4762,B00139TT72,Doggy Prison Food,"I feed my dog Royal Canine brand which I typically have to mix with chicken stick or wet canned food for her to eat - I thought this stuff would be more flavorful and easy to serve.  Upon opening I could tell I made a mistake - smells like cardboard - my dog won't eat it no matter how I dress it up, much less could I get her to eat it plain.  Plus, it has none of the science behind it like higher end brands like Royal Canine - the Newman brand is spreading itself too thin here - they should stick with pasta sauce."

16109,B000II27QE,Spotted Richard,"This pudding is delicious and I guess because I grew up in England and didn't emigrate to the US until 1964, I couldn't understand what all the fuss was about regarding Dick; it must be the spotted part that made people so silly.  The name was changed in 2001 to Spotted Richard because, apparently, some women were embarrassed to ask for this when shopping.  However, after the name change, the product sat on the store shelves.  No one was buying Richard; too bloody boring.  Heinz realized it had made a mistake so changed the name back to Spotted Dick and the rest is history."
3726,B0045IK1CK,Nasty watery drink,"Just got a new keurig and immediately went on a search for<br />the best dark rich bold coffee (Caribou Mahogany) and other brands<br />with rich taste (Wolfgang is winning so far) but really wanted to find<br />the best hot cocoas and got these first...now trying to give them away.<br />The are even worse than the packaged kind you get in the stores. Actually,<br />I think I've found better instant ones. I hate to write a bad review but..if<br />you want to find a DELICIOUS cocoa mix in the K-cups...get the Grove (Station) brand<br />here on Amazon.  They are always sold out (which DUH I know why now as they are a far better<br />tasting brand) but if<br />you put your email on a wait list, they'll let you know when they come in and<br />you dont have to wait very long.  I'd stock up though, as you'll find you want a cup<br />or two every night! (and the dark, milk and peppermint combined box is the bomb!!)I just<br />sent a couple boxes out to a friend of mine who was complaining about how bad the k cup hot<br />chocolates were....she'll be thrilled to get my care package!!"
328747,B000NN1X7I,Dentyne Ice Mints. Truly the strongest mint available.,I can't find this product in any of my local California stores so I value this retailer. I would reccomend them.
2398,B0089SPDUW,First impression: chocolate,"This is probably my favorite k-cup so far. I'm no professional taster so talk of flavor notes in coffee or elsewhere usually leaves me scratching my head and thinking, ""if you say so..."". But at my first sip of this dark, smooth coffee, I though chocolate. It's not flavored or sweet but, for me, it has a ""note"" of good, dark chocolate. Highly recommended if you like your coffee strong and full of flavor."
55790,B000HD7N7I,Buttered plastic?,Each bag was covered on the outside with butter between the popcorn bag and sealed plastic wrapping. I don't understand how this could happen but it did and with every popped bag you get a butter covered bag! Not good.
1582,B001CWZXIY,Passed the taste test!,"Everyone should know this is a healthier dog food than walmart brands, like purina, iams, or god forbid moist & meaty. Ingredients like ground flax seed, peas, whole carrots, whole sweet potatoes, apples, blueberries and probiotics and the lack of sweeteners, by-products, and low-quality corn show this to be true.<br /><br />I just did a taste test with this harmonic farms and my dogs old iams ProActive Health and decided to make the results known. I let him smell both thoroughly without letting him eat at first, and placed the two piles a bit apart. He immediately went for the harmonic farms, finished it and didn't even look at the iams before coming back to me wagging his tail hoping for more.<br /><br />Dogadvisor.com made me aware of my past mistakes in dog food choices and I was hoping to god he would not shy away from the healthy organic stuff like I do. To my great welcome surprise, he didn't! I guess he's a hippie at heart. I on the other hand, will take my nachos bell grande."
55764,B00141QYMC,DO NOT BUY,"DO NOT BUY.... These are made in China!  I do not know if you have seen or read the recent information about dog treats (Chicken Jerky) that are made in China, but they are killing dogs.  I advise you to contact your vet if you do not believe me.  This company states right on their website that they get their treats from china, because they do not want to cause more waste.  I am sorry your company is called DOGSWELL!!!! If you cared about dogs well being then STOP getting your chicken from China and get it from somewhere safe in the US.<br /><br />They are only getting one star because it is needed to post a review."
6601,B002BRC562,"Not too sticky, great for long runs!","I'm not a fan of messy gels, or stopping for PowerAde during a race. When I do my own long runs or if I'm doing a half, mess and inconvenience factor aside I also don't want to consume junk. These are organic and contain honey, and while soft & squishy somehow don't get stuck to each other when shoved in a gel pocket during a run. The taste is so delicious that my son tries to swipe them as well!"
6049,B000H227BG,Great hot chocolate!,This is the best hot chocolate next to Cadbury bought in Europe.  Our 13 yr old would never drink her chocolate milk until we switched to this (unfortunately we don't have a steady supply of Cadbury's).  It's great!
578,B000G6RYNE,"YUM! If you want a snack, have something REALLY good!","I've found a new taste treat. I'm not a big one for potato chips, so I am sure I've come late to discover these. I think they are really good.  The processing & ingredients list is actually pretty good-no trans fats, etc. So, if you want an indulgence, these are A+ !  They are thicker & more tasty than the mass produced potato chips we've all come to know.  They are much more flavorful.  Never had a honey-dijon potato chip before. Incredibly good & a flavorful combination of sweet, tangy, salty. Also not overly hot or spicy. Excellent!<br /><br />If you want a snack, have something REALLY good. It's got to be worth the calories-and these are!"
13297,B003H26J5I,Fantastic and Delicious,"Don't let the stories of tough preparation fool you; these are no more difficult to prepare than regular pasta. I rinse it in a colander to get rid of the musty smell and throw into boiling water for a couple of minutes. Then I pan fry them with sauce, spinach, garlic, mushrooms- whatever I'm in the mood for. It's a great meal for under 100 calories."
31325,B000JWGFRG,In the garbage it went!,I had high hopes of this being delicious but was very disappointed in the flavor and texture.  It felt slimy on my tongue and the flavor was not even close to tasting like any ranch dressing I've ever had. I threw them away:(
7389,B001EPQQL2,Nice for baking,I have used this in my baking with the regular splenda and it works great! Always trying to cut calories with out loosing flavor. Works great in my muffins with just a touch of sugar.
2512,B0079LSXQ6,Addictive,"I normally bake from scratch but when I saw this pink lemonade cake mix with matching frosting I just had to try them both. This cake can be made two ways: with or without egg yolks. I recommend with as the cake will be nice and moist as a result. This cake would also be just as good with plain white icing or just a dusting of powdered sugar. You can make it as a layer, bundt, or sheet cake, or as cupcakes. I picked it up at the grocery store recently for about $1.80 per box, the frosting was about the same price per can. I ended up going back and purchasing more for later as I believe this is just a seasonal flavor and Pillsbury will pull it from the market at some point. If they do I hope they bring it back every spring. Until then I'll be stocking up."
436391,B000FFLTDM,not for me,The taste of this product is not what I thought it would be. The price is ok..the delivery on time. Again taste not up to par.
44991,B0029NTQ1K,Im skeptical as to what is in these things!,So my cat loves these things. She practically hisses at me at random times and jumps on the counter throws the bag on the floor and starts swatting the bag all over the house. I then put them in the cubbard and I found her in the cubbard one day crying to get out. Its insane. She acts like someone on crack. Im starting to question what they put in these. Is there really a lot of regulation regarding cat snacks. I doubt it. Ive tried to stop giving them to her but she then turns her back to me and pouts for days to weeks on end. It has taken me a while to figure out what was going on with her and I have narrowed it down to these Temptation snacks. Im concerned about what drugs they put in these.
81125,B0040DWCXG,Awesome product for gluten-free baking,"We have to do a bunch of gluten free baking for my family.  This is the second time I have purchased this exact product.  I was disappointed to see that the cost went up 5$ since last year, but it's still about 7-8$ then purchasing at local retail shops.  This lasted us about 1 year using it for our baked goods."
3723,B0045IK1CK,Cafe Escapes Dark Choloate hot cocoa,This product is not sweet enough for me and tastes better with marshmellows already in the cup while brewing. Watery texture was a disappointment.
61185,B000FA38ZY,...product arrived in a condition that was not acceptable,This product arrived in a condition that was not acceptable.  The chocolate was discolored and the cookies were broken apart.  They look so unappetizing that I did not want to eat them and therefore didn't.  I wondered if they were stored in a warehouse that was not climate controlled.
206089,B0009H9SMU,It's not Postum,Thank you for the comparison.  The only similarity I found between Postum & Pero are the ingredients. The conclusion I came to is processing & amounts of individual ingredients must hold the keys to the differences in texture & taste.  I am not a fan of the powdery Pero.
7085,B004K30HO2,Waste of money,"I tried these disposaKups several times, and each time the filter came loose at the top resulting in coffee and grounds everywhere.  The kup and lid are both made from flimsy plastic that softens at the brewing temperature.  The result is a loose fit at the top during brewing, distortion of kup at the bottom (because filter is forced down) and coffee and grounds everywhere.  The lids work one time with OEM Keurig kups (cleaned and refilled), but the second time they are loose and result in overflow.  An email to the company for a refund was not answered.  Do not buy these!"

31183,B007M83302,Gross!,"I just cannot understand the high praise these chips have received.  I ordered the variety pack and am very disappointed.  All flavors have a really weird taste to them, except for maybe the plain chips.  The salt and vinegar especially tasted gross!  I took one bite and had to throw the bag away.  Now I'm stuck with a bunch of chips that I'll never eat."
56637,B0012XBD7I,Disgusting,"These chips are nasty.  I thought someone had spilled a drink in the bag, no the chips were just soaked with grease.  Nasty!!"
55921,B003EX2ECM,Bad Ju Ju,You don't want to put this stuff on your food.  It is potentially dangerous.  They use enzymes from cow or pig blood to produce this product and therefore it could be dangerous if the meat is not cooked well-done to burnt.<br /><br />This stuff has been around for 6 or so years now and explains why some meats we've bought at the grocery store look the way (shape) they do.  God didn't produce these foods like that!<br /><br />Oui Vey
3845,B002979DP0,Delicious alternative to soda,"My review is of the Strawberry-Melon flavor only. I did not try the other flavors in the variety pack as I puchased mine individually.<br /><br />I don't usually drink these types of beverages, nor do I drink much soda. I generally dislike overly sweet, artificial ingredient laden stuff. Quite by chance I tried a Strawberry Melon FUZE slenderize beverage and really liked it.<br /><br />What I liked most was the pleasing flavor and the absence of sugar, although it does have sucralose as a sweetener (rather than aspartame). It was not overly sweetened and the blend of strawberry and melon flavor was for me perfectly balanced; I could clearly distinguish both flavors.  FUZE was really tasty, no strong aftertaste and no sugar ""heaviness"" in the mouth. It was honestly the first time I've had this type of beverage other than a Snapple Tea beverage that I would purchase again.<br /><br />I'm a little skeptical of the benefits of the micro-nutrients that are added to this beverage; L-Carnitine, Super Citrimax and Chromium. Perhaps it's a bit more marketing hype rather than beneficial. Nonetheless, I found this beverage to be refreshing, tasty and something I would buy again.<br /><br />It is a little bit pricey though. Compared to a 12-pack of store brand Diet Soda, which in my neck of the woods ia around $2.99 or a little over $.02/ounce, FUZE beverage is priced $24.99 for 15-18.5 ounce bottles, or a little over $.09/ounce. That makes it more than 4 times as expensive as the store brand diet sodas.<br /><br />In spite of the price, I would buy this again and would justify the price by considering this more of a treat rather than a water substitute.<br /><br />5 stars."

3372,B005K4Q1VI,This hits the spot!,"Sometimes, I'd rather have cocoa instead of coffee at work. This meets my cocoa craving. I do not need to add sugar - just add water and brew!"
2259,B003NZH3VS,Disappointing,"I bought this for our young son and was disappointed in several aspects of this dispenser:<br /><br />(1) It's made of cheap plastic and arrived w/ the globe scratched and cracked.<br /><br />(2) The top doesn't screw on--it just pops off w/ very little exertion.<br /><br />(3) Part of the appeal for me was that this dispenser is coin-operated.  What the description on Amazon doesn't tell you, however, is that a coin is not necessary to dispense the candy.  Furthermore, when the crank is just barely turned, the candy (usually two pieces) flies out so quickly that some goes on the floor w/o your hand there to catch it.  A young child is often not coordinated enough to turn the crank and put his hand out to catch the candy.<br /><br />(4) The dispenser only came w/ enough candy to just fill the bottom of the globe.<br /><br />(5) It is very much over-priced at $29.99."
3397,B005K4Q1VI,Surprisingly good,"It appears a little watery, but the taste is not bad at all.  If you have kids that are as fascinated by the Keurig as you are, they'll probably enjoy this."
1980,B005HGAVGA,Some Variety,"I have had the regular Donut House coffee before and enjoyed it, but I had never had the flavored kind.  I was looking for a sampler pack to so my roommate and I could try the flavors as well as get some of the regular stuff.  I don't drink decaf, so I knew that some of this pack would not be used.  I figured that the rest of the cups would make up for the loss on the decaf.  I was wrong.  This ""Sampler"" pack was a joke.  18 of the cups were decaf, and 15 of them were the standard house brew.  I got 1 cup of Chocolate Glazed Donut and 1 cup of Cinnamon Roll.  Now, I will not be using most of the K-cups in this package because it was, again, MOSTLY DECAF!!!!!  This is what they consider a sample pack:<br /><br />8 Donut House Regular<br />9 Donut House Decaf<br />7 Donut Shop Regular<br />9 Donut Shop Decaf<br />1 Donut House Chocolate Glazed Donut<br />1 Donut House Cinnamon Roll<br /><br />Some sample....."
7317,B000GJF5AA,Best Bean Soup in a Bag,This soup has fantastic flavor. I did not add the canned tomatoes but I did add all the extra vegetables in the my fridge.
7090,B004K30HO2,DisposaKups are Fantastic,"When I bought my Keurig Brewer, I was so impressed at how it worked.  The different types of coffee and how it brewed.<br />HOWEVER - I did not realize how expensive the coffee K-cups would be.  I couldn't spend 80.00 dollars a month on coffee!!<br /><br />Then I found DISPOSAKUPS - What a great idea and they are so easy to use. The very best part about them is that fact that they can be thrown away - No having to wash the insert that Keurig provides.<br /><br />These cups do not leak.  They work perfectly!  I will be ordering more."

3125,B004JQVASM,Ugh.,"This coffee smells really bad - there is definitely no ""delicious"" smell as it brews or as you take sips from your mug.  It tastes just as awful too.  The first couple sips that I had, with my nose closed so I couldn't smell it, wasn't too bad but the more sips I took the more disgusting it was.  It is absolutely stomach turning (to me at least) and unfortunately I will never drink the whole bag. It tastes like a weak, poorly brewed, cheap cup of coffee (though not cheap!).  The only positive note is that it did not irritate my bladder - just irritated my nose and taste buds."

On a recent trip to Italy we bought the lavazza rosa espresso and I was able to find it and order it on amazon. I bought the gevalia just to try something new and based on the reviews I thought it might be a good idea. My husband loves it and actually prefers it to the Lavazza.  I just bought another 3 pack. we use a stove top Bialetti and this is fine for that type of maker. Highly recommend!!!
2120,B0064MEUS6,Don't waste your money,"The site doesn't list the ingredients for their products online.  Had I known the product was full of trans fats I would not have ordered it.  Watch your labels.  Partially hydrated = partially hydrogenated.  You have to laugh at the ways manufacturers will try to fool the public.  In the future I will not order a product that doesn't list its ingredients online so that consumers can make informed purchases.<br /><br />Did try the product and found it tasteless.  No heat/spice and it left a waxy film on the roof of the mouth, must be from the wax.  I was going to send it to my son in college but tossed it in the trash instead.  The sad thing is that they do NOT have to use trans fats to get flavor.  They just don't care."
52956,B004754DO8,Beware of chicken treats made in China,There have been reports of dogs getting sick and even dying from eating chicken treats made in China.  Buyer beware!!  Check in out online.
2850,B0085G4ACA,Coconut Water,"After reading about the benefits of coconut water, I decided to give this brand a try.  I have tried a few other brands with a juice added, but they all have lot of extra sodium.  Be sure to read the labels.  Some have less potassium in them than the Via Coco brand.  I felt like this was better for my husband to drink than Gatorade. He works on a/c during the summer and is out in the heat all day long."
50301,B000FBQ50I,bal,"Bahlsen Butter Cookies,4.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)<br />Very Disappointed with your service and deceptive listing of the product ingredients. i am allergic eggs and as per your listing, there is NO mention of eggs and when i received the product, on the box the cookies one of the ingredient is EGG.<br />Also i emailed not send me any cookie with EGGS"
30541,B006WJHOX4,riuned boxes,"When I rec'd the boxes of Raisin Bran, the outside box was crushed on one end, and pulled apart on the other end,<br />  needless to say the cereal boxes were open and dented badly, not sure if I want to continue with your<br />  subscription services, if packaging is to continue this way.  C."
360028,B003Y3F5R8,Larissa loves it!,"My daughter likes it now, but when she was younger she did not want to have it! Go figure! Now she is almost 14 months she digs the flavor."
28003,B004FO99BS,Marrons Glaces,"Gave this as a gift to a French friend. She felt it was not like the MG's she was used to in France. Something about the ""glace"" part. The sugary cover was not right. I had one, and it was quite sticky. Wonder if the quality is affected by storage/shipping/transportation conditions."
2965,B000GJQ8J2,Love this dressing! - Wild Thymes Products: Meyer Lemon Dressing,"I found Wild Thymes many years ago and have continued to use their products - the Lemon Salad Refresher is my favorite salad dressing, it is light, now cal, and very tasty. Excellent on any green or pasta salad and especially good on fresh Heirloom tomatoes with fresh avocado slices. Yum! Their Customer Service is excellent and helpful, and the site shares some great recipes as well. I'm a fan."
8398,B003VXFK44,Awesome Coffee,I love this coffee. Great taste and great way to start your morning. If you like flavored coffee you will like this.
33957,B00412W76S,Do not order this product....,"It has been over three weeks and I still have not received this product.  And, they have charged me for it already..."
219820,B004SKZWBK,good formula,My son loves this. He's been taking this since he's 1 year old.We will continue this product til he's 2 years of age.
6857,B001LG945O,Smooth flavor,Expecting something like Fanta or Sunkist I was surprised how smooth and subtle Switch is. Definitely a good combination of refreshment and flavor. Love the fact that it doesn't tast too carbonated.
7346,B0049ZCFUA,Best marinade for Fried Turkey Ever,"This is the best marinade to inject in a Fried Turkey EVER made!  You don't have to add anything of your own (maybe a little olive oil, but that's all).  Plus there is a shaker mix you can buy to sprinkle on the top of the turkey, BUT this marinade can be injected to make a tender, juicy fried turkey.  We LOVED it!"
7052,B004K30HO2,Great product quick delivery,This is a great product and would highly recommend to all Keurig fans. You can make your own k cups at a fraction of the cost.
317182,B0002DK60E,Works great as a regular litter pan BUT,I STILL have to scoop  and this is vastly overpriced for a regular hooded box.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!
388,B001ESOQAM,Fresh - Whole.. perfect,"I ordered these after a fair bit of searching online - even ordering the smaller 1-3oz bags. I will admit, I was a bit sceptical when I ordered this since it was not cheap and had no idea how good (or bad) the cashews would be...<br /><br />The order came in pretty fast - like 3 days. The cashews were fresh and whole - with like 10 broken pieces. They were in 2 5lb bags sealed with clear tape.. first I found it odd but then it turned out to be a good deal; considering the second pack stayed fresh till I opened them. The trick is to actually keep them in an air-tight box so that they stay fresh longer.<br /><br />The only negative I can think of is that the price went up abt $5.00 for the 10lb since I bought them."
178583,B00013C2TS,Not at all what I expected,"For one thing, this was about a month late.  It was a shipping issue so I won't count that against the product.  The soups that come in the basket, there are 4 of them, are just enough to make 1 cup each!  What a rip-off!  The presentation is not that great either."
2478,B002JX7GVM,"Smaller-than-usual package size, overly-sweet taste","My top line advice: If you want coconut water with a touch of pineapple, get the Vita Coco, not this one.<br /><br />Size: The size is 8.5 fl oz per package. I didn't pay close attention when ordering, and expected the larger, 11.5 oz size. Not a big deal, and was my fault, but it's a little too small to be useful.<br /><br />Taste: Ick. I love coconut water. I love pineapple juice. I love lightly flavored coconut water. This tastes like none of the above. The flavor is sickly sweet (ingredients included added sugar), and with none of the nice mellow coconut flavor of other coconut waters I've tried. Might as well be a processed kids drink.<br /><br />Alternatives: While I actually prefer O.N.E.'s regular, unflavored coconut water over other brands, the Vita Coco coconut water with a splash of pineapple is far superior to this one. It comes in a larger package, doesn't have added sugar, has more vitamins and nutrients (this one is diluted with sugar water), and tastes like you're drinking it fresh on the beach. This one is just...not great."
16817,B001LGGH40,"Very tasty, sweet and tart","This carbonated fruit drink reminds me a little of Mountain Dew Code Red, except this is 100% fruit juice (apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry, and strawberry) reconstituted from concentrate with sparkling water.  It has 33 grams of sugar in an 8.3 ounce can, but at least it's natural sugar from the fruit rather than corn syrup.<br /><br />It has a rather strong sweet/sour taste, I would think you need to like fruity sour flavors to like this drink.  I think they could reduce the fruit juice content about 1/3 and it would still be very tasty and have less sugar.<br /><br />Still for me this would rate 5 stars except for the price, at almost $1 per can unfortunately I don't think I would buy it very often."
28860,B000NME632,Take care when you order-,"After I purchased this for a gift, I was told that the enclosed cold pack had melted.  Soggy peppermint patties weren't the treats that I had intended to send."
5062,B007OWEOIQ,Delicious!,"I absolutely love these! Seven of these sweet, very thin Graham Crisps are only 60 calories, but it's easy to eat a lot of them and there are almost 80 in the package. Delicious by themselves; wonderful with ice cream. If they are purchased using Amazon's Add-on Program there is no shipping charge.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I've seen mixed reviews of this company's products. The items I've purchased have not been stale or strange smelling."
70481,B002E0S4UW,applesauce on the go,"My grandson and a freinds daughter loves these packetage of applesauce,and it don't make a mess, can take it any where."
25174,B0081XIA1E,Fun toy that challenges dog,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:54 Mins<br /><br /></span>Bandit loves this toy, however after a while it was no longer a challenge for him."
2450,B002JX7GVM,Sweet but not too sweet!,"Let me be honest, I wasn't expecting this to be very good. I received a sample and it sat in the fridge for a good week before I was brave enough to give it a taste.<br /><br />At first sip, it was much sweeter than I expected it to be. I could certainly taste the pineapple, but the coconut flavor was much more pronounced than I thought it would be. It was good! I very much enjoyed the taste of the drink. It was exotic and refreshing. It was much fuller in weight, as I was thinking it would be watery with a mild flavor.<br /><br />The box reminded me of those chocolate milks that I buy for my kids, but it didn't detract from the flavor."
6273,B000KOSDY6,First Ingredient is sugar...dessert for sure!,"I had never made this or had it at a mexican food diner, so I did not know what to expect.  It is good and very moist, but if you use creamed corn with added sugar in it your muffins or corn loaf will be very sweet.  I will make my own cream corn to add next time instead of using Libby's canned cream corn which is high in salt and sugar.  I like sweets but this was a little over the top using canned cream corn. The first ingredient in the dry mix is sugar, not Corn Masa as listed on the Amazon site so be advised this is definitely a dessert."
50369,B000K9WLNK,daughter's favorite cereal,"I purchased these cereals for my daughter.  She loves this cereal and she wanted to take them to work for her breakfast. I could always find frosted flakes and some of the other cereals in the little package to carry along with you, but I searched all over in the stores for Lucky Charms in the little package and I couldn't find them for anything.  I went on amazon to search for them and of course amazon had them.  Thank you amazon because these cereals are so convenient to carry along with you."
304141,B001AS1A4Q,Husband prefers it to Red Bull,For the longest time my husband drank Red Bull to give him that buzz. But it's always short lived so he always brought a few to work. This one seems to be working for him. Obviously it's much smaller than a Red Bull but it gives you more boost. Not 5 hours as advertised but at least a bit longer than Red bull. He likes the taste too.
270,B000LKZK7C,Excellent but not perfect,"This is a delicious sugar. It has a pretty light brown color and delicious aroma. But the granules are quite big, however -- bigger than plain refined sugar. This makes is difficult to cream butter and sugar together. But if you use it in a recipe where you will melt the sugar first before baking it, or if you use it to brew beer and plan to boil it to melt it, it is a great product. It would be the perfect sugar if only the granules were a bit finer."
39125,B0046ANN2C,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,"I purchased this product both for my dog and my daughters dog and it gave them both extreme diarrhea, explosive poor pups couldn't even make it out of the house. VERY embarrassed dogs!!! Both dogs suffered from this product.  We administered the exact amount for the weight of each dog.  They both LOVE their Greenies so I was shocked with this reaction."
454,B000G6RYNE,Yum!,My husband and I LOVE these chips! Personally I think the flavor is perfect. Try them for yourself!
194489,B003ZT61E2,Slightly beyond acceptable,This product is just slightly beyone acceptable.  There actually is a hint of peppermint in it but what else?  The main ingredient is sugar.  Just reading the label made me feel as if I was participating in a science experiment.  It also left a chemical aftertaste.  I would not recommend this product.
18027,B008ZRKZSM,Overpriced on Amazon,Strange pricing on Amazon when you can get 4 for $15.96 at the company's site that makes this (Bell Plantation).
1926,B0016PKA1C,Wilted hopes,"I wanted very much to like this product, but after using it for more than 9 months, I just can't. The clear plastic cover is very difficult to get off, especially when the pod is filled with water. It's also difficult to get the cover on, especially when you're trying to store bushy herbs like parsley or cilantro. The o-ring that is supposed to seal the bottom of the pod doesn't seem to seat correctly. After removing the bottom of the pod to clean out dirt left behind from some rooted herbs, I've never again been able to get it to be water-tight. Consequently, every time I use my pod,I have to store it in a bowl or else I'm mopping up water from my fridge shelf. On the plus side, the leaky bottom helps to remind me to change the water every day!"
206453,B0000CF8T1,Coffee Filters,If you cook your coffee on the stove or in an electric percolator you<br />gonna want these. Keeps the grounds where they are suppose to be.
66754,B001ONVON4,I like Cheez-its!!,"From the grocery store!! Four boxes arrived broken and crumbled. There seems to a packaging flaw. Oh, well back to the super markets for me."
11047,B0000VYKXC,Bring Back Verona,"As a perusal of comment about Verona Dark will show, the fans of regular Verona are terribly disappointed that their favorite coffee is being discontinued. It's your company and you can run it any way you please. Conclusion: Unless there is a specific reason to discontinue regular Verona, the decision to do so is (for me terribly) ill-advised.<br /><br />There. How's that for potentially positive and useful feedback?<br /><br />PS: I cannot choose the product you want me to specify, because you mention only DARK Verona."
196269,B001E95KO2,Beware... Natural Flavoring added to tea !!!,This stuff tastes awful !!! I threw it all out and bought a pound of organic chamomile leaves here on Amazon - do your life a flavor and get yo mighty self away from this tea company !!! San Rafael Ca? yuck!!!
5210,B000G1X456,"Smotth and never bitter, even when made extra strong","Yuban makes the best cup of coffee. Either roast is never bitter, and makes a great cup of coffee. We like our coffee extra-strong, and we have been using Yuban for years. The coffee is very consistent and distinctive.<br /><br />This is the best canned ground coffee out there, period. We have found none to match the true dark, smooth cup of coffee. There is no bitterness or burnt taste, just silky, rich coffee. Add a dab of half-n-half, and you have bliss in a cup.<br /><br />Don't spend your money on the expensive ""designer"" coffees. This is the best!<br /><br />If you are persnickety about coffee, buy Yuban!"
329729,B002QWHJOU,Greenies,My dogs look forward to this treat every morning. It helps the breath issue and satisfies the chewing need as well! I can't be without them.
122665,B00416MT4Y,Cinnamon sticks,This product was not what we though it was going to be. the Cinnamon Sticks were going to be used for chewing on as a means of releaving stress. This is a coping skill used in Reh. The inside of the Cinnamon sticks just crumbeled once place into you mouth. We didnt know there was a differnce in Cinnamon Sticks. We now know to watch out.
7724,B001E5DZTS,The BEST!!!!,"I have been drinking this powdered goat milk for years! It is the best no after taste with all the immune boosting benefits! I have an 8mos. Old and plan to feed him this starting on his first birthday, I cannot wait! My husband grew up on goat milk and has the best immunity! This is so easy to digest within 20 minutes vs. cow milk which takes more than 24 hrs.!<br /><br />Above all it tastes so DELISH!!!!! YUMMMY!<br /><br />amazon truly has unbelievable price! luv my Amazon:)"
209392,B0027Z54D4,"Yes, overpriced. Save your money","I bought a case of these for my granddaughter at college. After I ordered, I told my wife what I had done. She informed me that these sell for $0.36/ea at Wal-Mart. This price was $0.63/ea.<br /><br />Okay, dear, I'm a dweeb. Should've asked you first.<br /><br />Save your money folks. Shop local on this one."
8938,B0007A0AP8,Better than dessicated liver or pepperoni!,"These are not the tough, durable jerky that I was expecting, but small, soft, chewy squares.  They break up easily into tiny BB sized balls (maybe 12 per square) and my puppies will do ANYTHING for them! Best dang training aide on the market!"
18279,B000SATIGO,Disappointment,"I was sadly disappointed in this brand of Assam tea. Once properly brewed, the tea was weak. When I brewed another pot, I added more tea, in the hopes of making it drinkable.  The second pot was weak, and bitter."
7013,B004K30HO2,K-Cups on the custom side!,"Love the product! I can now custom blend my personal favorite coffee blends, and get them CHEAPER than buying pre-fab K-cups!"
1742,B001RVFDOO,Eat without feeling guilty!,Fabulous - tasty but not awful for you!  I've already recommended to folks I work with.  Will continue to purchase!
4337,B004391DK0,Grainy texture,I am giving this two stars as my family didnt mind the taste but the texture was so grainy and the biscuts fell apart easily. I was not a fan of the pancakes at all I believe they really didnt have a good flavor. Will not be wasting my money on such a tiny package either when you can but a bigger package of regular mix for less? Not fair to us with allergies in my opinion!!
9337,B006N3IG4K,Awesome Taste,"Tried this for the first time this week and it is now my favorite coffee --with a hint of flavor (coconut). Full bodied, and no after taste, Jamaica Me Crazy is just what I love for an afternoon pick-me up, or to wake up and have an immediate smile on my face. Seriously -- It's Awesome! Highly Recommended."
2818,B003TIUM5S,BEST CEREAL EVER!,"Let me first say that I don't eat cereal as a general rule.  I just don't like it.  I don't drink milk EVER, so eating dry cereal isn't always a treat.  I purchased a box of this for my husband.  I ended up trying some because it just looked so pretty in the bowl....and I was HOOKED!  This cereal is tasty and healthy and I eat it everyday now with my yogurt.  I can't give it enough stars!"
426038,B000TQEWM2,"For me, too bitter, prefer richer tasting blend","I prefer my hazelnut with a richer, fuller taster, which Gloria Jean's did not seem to have at all."
27446,B003FX8L4G,Cheaper than the gas station!,"My daughter loves these and there is only one gas station in the Marietta, Georgia are that sells them..they chage 30cents a lolipop!!"
54383,B0009JRKDC,Great product,"Coconut oil has helped to lower my cholesterol dramatically in only a few months, along with other dietary changes. The only problem with this product is that it is packaged in plastic rather than glass, so I might not buy it again from this company. The supplier/shipper also poorly wrapped the jar for shipping."
338302,B002T0GXNC,Out of line prices.,Check around your local chain stores.<br />Prices are about 1/2 of what they are on here and you dont have to wait to get them.
28866,B000NME632,"Taste fine, however...","I stopped buying these when I noticed they now contain ""PGPR"".  (Google it)<br /><br />I now buy only Pearson's mint patties."
137849,B005ISQ5XA,Makes Great Drinks,The wife got a coffee frappe maker and uses this mix to make them at home. Saves quite a bit buying in bulk instead of paying $4+ for a frappe elsewhere!!<br /><br />Try it....
73594,B002C6IM2S,lol! a tree? its just a plant!,"Was supposed to be a tree....I got a small, sad looking plant! Expensive tiny plant that sheds. I accepted the so called tree as it was, and wasn't mad until I went to the grocery store and saw the exact plant, but full and BIGGER for $4.99!!!! Disappointing. I wanted a tree. Well, kinda like the PICTURE."
22188,B000KV61FC,???,"My dog can't seem to figure this one out.  No matter how much he tugs on it, the food doesn't come out.  We prefer the Kong Wobbler.  This was a waste of our money."
233814,B006PFOVKY,Not the item that is pictured!!,"I ordered this thinking it would look like the picture associated with it, but it was nothing like it. It was a chew stick, not a bone, not organic, that is for dogs 25-60 pounds and I have a dog around 8 pounds, so just beware!"
71756,B007RTR8AC,Cleans well and doesn't give oily rebound,When I first saw the shampoo I was skeptical- it looked the consistency of white hand lotion and I was afraid it would hold down my fine hair.  But it doesn't. The smell is light and the shape of the shampoo container is opposite of the conditioner so people with bad eyes won't confuse them while in the shower without glasses. It is too soon to know if this will help hair grow by nourishing the roots but when used with the matching conditioner and a blow-dryer it seems to have a lasting lift.  I've used it twice. Will report back if there is long term hair growth (although that might be more than a shampoo can do.)
5719,B002ANCCK6,Cat couldn't get enough,"My cat loved this food for a long time. However, he has been picky lately. It's been harder and harder to get him to eat this, but the variety offered in this cat food is good and seemed to keep my cat healthy!"
463531,B000GW67KY,Received expired product,"I ordered this on April 29, 2011, and received it on May 2, 2011. The product expired in March. I am only giving this one star because that is the lowest rating that I can give. If it weren't for the one star minimum, I would give it 0 stars."
8793,B000M5PP8U,Best steak rub ever!,My husband and I found this rub in a little market in Philly a few years ago.  We have since purchased it religiously since.  It adds great flavor to steaks that now can't eat a steak without it.  It is definitely a must try!
5858,B001EQ5EJQ,Pleasant Flavor,"Enjoyed the product, pleasant flavor,  used it to in all my cooking, i will be purchasing it again. Cans were dented on arrival... but did not harm the product."
512496,B000FDP6GU,squid in ink sauce,The can is a bit more difficult to open compared to others.  Has a tasty ink sauce.
285719,B0088OIAKW,My sick cat loved this stuff,I had an elderly cat with kidney disease and stomach tumors.  I think this cat food extended his life by a couple months.  It looks and smells like real human food.
44248,B004MGOUCW,Doesn't Taste Like A&W and Small,"I like A&W root beer. Years ago our household had a blind taste test of the major root beers and we concluded A&W is the best tasting brand, by far, with a great creamy texture. So, if these frozen pops tasted like the beverage, I'd have rated them highly. Unfortunately, they do not. Somewhere in the translation from frothy, fizzy cold soda to flat, frozen stick, the essence of A&W was lost leaving an oddly flavored unenjoyable confection.<br /><br />Also these pops are much smaller than I think they should be or at least how I remember similar sleeve enclosed treats being.<br /><br />Having said all this, my children ran through these like ravenous monkeys, so maybe children's taste buds can find something to like."
2448,B0089SPDUW,Smooth But Flat,"This coffee is very smooth but rather flat compared to Starbuck's brews.  It doesn't have any bite to it.<br />If you like a mild coffee, you will enjoy this one."
120518,B005K4Q37A,Good stuff!,"This product was just what I was looking for.  For those complaining of the taste, YES it does taste like something that comes out of those machines in convenience stores!  But that is just what I was hoping for, and got."
665,B002BCD2OG,My Go to sweetner,"I am so glad I was introduced the this brand of sweetner to replace sugar, this is so much better. I really like how it sweetens my herbal sweet teas without having to use too much, and how it can be used in place of pancake syrup too. Learning how to use it what the first thing I had to learn, once I learned how to use it, I became hooked. I would not even look at sugar any more. I highly reccomend if you want a clean fresh taste and feel to your foods.If you do purchase this sweetner, take advantage of ship and save, it will save you lots of money in the long run."
3330,B005K4Q1VI,Grove Square Hot Chocolate is the best.,"Grove Square Hot Chocolate is the best K-cup hot chocolate. I read many reviews before making this purchase, and now I agree, and will continue to buy this brand."
384920,B003VD9Q1M,Great googlie mooglie,Fifty dollars?  You've got to be kidding me.  I could eat at a 5 star restaurant for that.
12196,B00141UC9I,Beware.... sudden change in product,"We have been ordering these chicken jerky treats for a long time with Amazon subscribe and save. My Boston Terriers really love them and get very excited to get their treat every morning. When I opened a bag from my most recent shipment, my dogs refused to take the treat from my hand. They took one sniff and backed away. My son's Lab got very sick from chicken jerky made in China and his vet told him to only buy treats made in the U.S.and I'm going to follow that advice."
217094,B000ESLJ6C,Pero replaces Postum!,"Looked all over for a replacement for POSTUM, and PERO does it - THANK YOU!!!"
340621,B006HXL6QG,Do people really purchase without knowing the size of the package?,"The 2 stars is for the listing, not the product.  The listing makes no indication of the size of the package.  For all we know we could be paying for 2 roasted peas."
224079,B003YBNK9K,"Cheaper elsewhere, but Yummy","I absolutely LOVE this stuff but, I only pay $2.09 for a box of 6 servings at my grocery store. This price here is a bit steep. I have to addmit I'm actually addicted,so be careful. I'd probably pay this price if I couldn't get it elsewhere though, cuz I'm addicted.  Do shop around."
233232,B007TJGZ4A,Hazelnut k-cups,These are so yum. They're my favourite flavoured coffee!  Wish they sold them in South Africa so that I didn't have to buy online only.
1413,B001EO7GAI,Disappointing...,I ordered this for gifts around Christmas time. I actually was hoping to use it for our Christmas day meal. Two out of the four jars I ordered were rotten and inedible. I never did get to try it and I was very annoyed and disappointed!
42716,B000OK2AG8,Not A Fan,"Let me first say that I am an AVID green tea drinker. I go through anywhere from 6-10 tea bags a day, so I am always on the hunt for new and better teas. That being said, I had really high hopes for an authentic Japanese Sencha. Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan of what I got.<br /><br />When I brewed my first batch of this tea, I noticed the very green color, which is hard to find in teas from America. But, when I started to smell the tea as it was steeping, it smelled like something familiar, but I just couldn't put my finger on it. The smell wasn't exactly bad, but it was definitely not how I wanted my tea to smell. Eventually it hit me. This tea smelled like CHICKEN NOODLE SOUP!<br /><br />At first I thought I was crazy, until other people would walk into my house and ask if I was making soup... The taste is very strong, and unusual. Needless to say, I only used about 4 out of the 100 tea bags. I won't be buying again."
4574,B002TMV3E4,Not Impressed,"Some reviewers say the coffee is bitter- I like bitter but I didn't like this. It wasn't a good bitter taste, it was a ""cringe"" kind of taste.<br /><br />I drink one of the strongest coffee's out there and this was too much for me. The strange taste of it turned me off...<br />I once owned a coffee pot by Melitta too, and it took a cone shaped special filter. I wasn't impressed with that either.<br /><br />Maybe i'm just not big on Arabica coffee or whatever it is but the taste was unpleasant to me. Not smooth. Bitter yes, but not smooth.<br /><br />It smells ok. I agree with Charlie ( another Amazon Reviewer) who said the package was difficult to open. It was sealed extremely tight and when you did eventually get it open, the bag tore apart.<br /><br />No way would I spend 20 bucks for this. If i was addicted to it, possibly, but even then that's steep. And I surely won't buy this in the future.<br /><br />You can go down to the local ""name of popular coffee shop here"" and get 2 bags for this price of FRESHLY ground coffee.<br /><br />Melitta makes it sound like it's the greatest thing since sliced bread on their package. Gourmet, Swiss water process, from Europe's charming sidewalk cafe's, top quality hand- picked beans..<br /><br />If you want to pay this kind of money and like Melitta coffee, then get it, but I don't think it's anything special."
7253,B00382UXU4,You must try this popcorn,"I purchased a hot air popcorn popper because my kids love popcorn, and it's a healthy snack.<br /><br />I 'accidentally' ordered the white popcorn, having no idea what I was doing, and I have to say that no other popcorn compares. We went through the entire container. When I re-ordered, I decided to try the regular yellow popcorn, and it just wasn't the same. If I could describe the difference, I would say that yellow popcorn tastes 'stale' in comparison. The white popcorn tastes crisper and more fresh.<br /><br />As for the flavor, well, we use Kernel Seasons seasoning generously, so we don't taste much more than the cheddar cheese :)<br /><br />I'm considering giving the rest of this yellow popcorn tub away so I have an excuse to buy another tub of the white popcorn.<br /><br />For how we eat it, this popcorn is absolutely the best!<br /><br />NOTE: I also recommend the Misto oil spray. We use this and Kernel seasons as a healthy alternative to butter."

267823,B000LQHPZ6,The best,Absolutely wonderful.<br />Can't make whipped cream without it.<br />It stabilizes the cream and<br />keeps it firm and non watery for days.<br /><br />A must for any home baker or any one who uses whip cream.
81728,B001VDXO3K,Too expensive on Amazon,My local Food Emporium at UWS carries this product for $4.19 per 34oz pack so this is way too expensive at Amazon for $5.50 per pack.
37973,B000F6SNPS,untruthful ingredients. Don't be fooled.,"Unlike the ingredients listed on this website, this Good Earth Caffeine Free Sweet & Spicy tea has artificial flavor added -- and it's the third ingredient, meaning that there's more artificial flavor than all the other ingredients except for rooibos and chicory root.<br /><br />I feel ripped of by Amazon's dishonesty of listing ingredients from another, completely different product on the page describing this artificially flavored tea.<br /><br />Even worse, I received this rubbish as part of my Subscribe and Save subscription. They replaced my original subscribed product, which wasn't artificially flavored, with this junk, and didn't have the balls to mention the COMPLETELY DIFFERENT INGREDIENTS.<br /><br />BUYER BEWARE."
46437,B002GJ9JWS,Yum!,"I am a peanut butter fanatic, but it was hard to eat a lot of it & stay within my calorie limits for the day. I was looking for a substitute that wasn't going to taste nasty and leave a weird aftertaste & I cam across PB2! I love the simple peanuty taste & it goes great in smoothies & in yogurt as well. Love this on a piece of whole wheat toast!"
512469,B004FGUYWY,Great flavor,My husband is a big coffee drinker. He enjoys this coffee. The price can not be found lower anywhere. I will continue to come back for re-orders.
12155,B00141UC9I,Too dry and sharp,"I had previously purchased the chicken and the duck from this line so I wanted to try the beef liver.<br />Well, my dog likes the flavor but I don't like how dry they are. They have very sharp edges and I had to be creative to soften them a bit so that my dog wouldn't suffer from a rapture in the esophagus while eating them as they are. The other 2 (chicken + duck) are a little chewer than this one. I would not buy this again unless texture improves."
448192,B0021L8XRS,Messy but enjoyable treat,"The only thing our 2 hounds like better are the bigger bones cured the same way.  They are messy and I suggest they become and ""Out door treat"" at least until all the meat is gone."
81104,B000O9WEY2,Just as expected,"Not much to say here - it's Quaker oatmeal, just in a bigger box than you'd get at the grocery store. My only problem is that there's plain in the box, but that's clearly visible, and I knew it when I bought it. I just wish they offered a big box without plain flavor."
2618,B0016FY6H6,Handy but not to tasty,This tea is not so tasty in my opinion. But one thing about opinions is that every one has one and we do not always agree.
35445,B001HWWLHA,Not a good flavor to me,This tea left a bad taste in my mouth. I found it very difficult to drink because it caused acid issues. I enjoy Timothy's white tea orange blossom much better and also the Timothy Cranberry.
7966,B004WM0ZTS,Amazing instant coffee,"As far as instant coffees go, this one is amazingly good.  Usually, I have to use sugar with instant coffee, as they generally taste really bitter.  Not so with this one.  I can drink it straight and it tastes like real coffee.<br /><br />While this will never fully replace brewed Starbucks coffee for me, it is still pretty good and I will be keeping it my desk at work."
74583,B001COE1AI,Stale each time,I bought these almonds twice (3 packs each) and both timese they were horrible. They were small and stale (all packs). Embarrassed to serve them to my friends. Would not recommend.

4338,B004391DK0,Works like Bisquick,"I love that it is mainstream and that it works like bisquick. Not all recipes work the same as regular bisquick though.. so I wish they had more recipes available. It does taste more ""gluten free"" than some other options out there."
59781,B000HIHE2W,CHECK THE EXPIRATION DATE,"I utilized Amazon's ""Subscribe and Save"" option.  The first time I made the rice, it didn't taste the same as the store bought rice.  Since I have a fairly large family, I assumed that doubling the recipe contributed to the negative outcome.  Unfortunately, I tried the rice again and wasn't pleased. A few weeks later, my son discovered that the rice expired within 1-2 months of our purchase.  Since we've never had problems with ""Rice A Roni"" before, I'm contributing the problem to the expiration date."
832,B000IXUISS,Very Different taste from the 'Made in UK' or 'Made in India' version.,The US made version of this Cadbury chocolate has a distinct taste from the UK version of the chocolate which I have been eating since childhood. I did not like this new taste. To all my friends from India -- buy this chocolate if it is either made in UK or India; otherwise you will be disappointed as I was.
14446,B00284TR82,Why not individual Boxes?,Boutght both frech vanilla and the caramel macchiata(sp).  Not eh caramel cam in 6 boxes of 24.  The french vanilla came in a bag! Just a plastic bag! Some of them were busted and leaking probably from shipping. I don't understand why the caramel ones come in boxes of 24 but the french vanilla comes in a bag? *shrugs*  I like the flavor just didn't like the way they shipped it.

277605,B000VK8AVK,Taste good and are filling.,"My family has really enjoyed these. Unfortunately, we can only get them online as no local grocery carries them yet.  We are asking every time we go."
3281,B005K4Q1VI,so so,very easy to use not the best flavor It has too much sugar and is not a quality I thought I was getting
1349,B000ODRY9I,"Sorry, taste is not pleasing.","I bought this for my husband since he loves Ranch. He uses ranch dressing with everything. Before I bought it, I read a review that said it taste good inspite of the fat-free... Well, my husband had it and says it's aweful. I guess ""to each his own"" everyone's tastebuds are not alike.  Someone else may like it, so I am not going to discourage anyone from trying it. However, I had to cancel my subscription because the only one that likes Ranch in the family, doesn't like this one. I guess he needs the fat:)"
36775,B001HTJ2BQ,"Used to be great, Not sure anymore",Same experience as others here<br /><br />Been buying this stuff forever and had an active subscription as well.<br />Last shipment said product of Sri lanka and it's just awful compared to the original version from Thailand<br />The only thing that remained the same was the company name<br />Need to find another brand now<br />Very unhappy about this
41388,B0096EZHM2,Price climber,My cats like the food but my wallet does not like the continually climbing prices.  For the first year I bought this the price was pretty stable but it is now going up every month or every other month.  Tooooooooo expensive.  :-(
37941,B000F6SNPS,What's happened to GE Original Sweet and Spicy?,Purchased two boxes of Sweet and Spicy decaf and it stinks!  It's not as sweet nor as spicy as it was before.  Really dissappointed and will stop buying it.  Just sorry I purchased two boxes as they'll both go to waste.
1683,B001RVFDOO,Pop Chips Rule,"I am a chip fanatic, when I heard of these, I HAD to give them a try! They are very tasteful esp. the bbq one's.  I have yet to try the other flavors but I am sure they will not disappoint.  I watch my weight/health so these are perfect, just becareful because they are addicting!"
267,B000LKZK7C,Sugar in the raw,Product is exactly as advertised.  What a savings!  At least half the retail price. Easy to store because of the individual packaging.
12702,B000N648JU,"Looks like vomit in a bowl, and my dogs HATE it!","I've got two dogs who will eat almost anything. I like to give them good, wholesome food and the increasing prices make it difficult. I purchased the Merrick Turducken as Merrick used to be a great company that made wonderful dog food that looked like human food. Not in this case! It looks, smells, and has the same appetizing effect on my dogs as if I'd thrown up in the bowl. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!! Neither of my dogs likes it and I'm stuck with an expensive case of food. My dogs both sniffed their bowls, then walked away. I'm feeding it to them as its bought and paid for, but I feel cruel doing so. They usually won't jump right into eating it, no matter how hungry they are. They do eat a little, but usually leave at least half in their bowl and that's so unlike them! Horrible dog food. Would never recommend to anyone. Looks disgusting and must taste the same the way my dogs are avoiding it."
149357,B0038PDDUS,Not worth the money,This was not worththe $100.00. The toy broke within one hour. The rest of the items were trading cards.
279641,B002Y7018S,Plastic bottles,"This product is packaged in plastic bottles.  I buy all of my spices, extracts, etc. in glass containers only. I would not have ordered this had I known it was shipped in plastic bottles. Because the price was low, we discarded the un-opened plastic bottles rather than try to return them."
5665,B007VXSSOE,Best sauce,"This is absolutely the best sauce for making Carolina BarB Q. I,ve looked for a long time and am glad that I finally found the best."
2309,B0002Z9BF8,Dog Treats,"The treats were ok,my main complaint is they were small about the size of a lifesaver.Which made it hard to give them to my medium size dog as a treat.One treat just di not do it.This package should be labeled for toy or small dogs."
404391,B001EQ5JMS,price,Just wanted to let everyone know that if you go to Publix (if you have it in your area)the price there for 10oz brick is 2.99 . you do the math
71538,B003BK0DX0,Contains CHICKEN,"Although these are a quality dog treat please be aware that these do contain chicken. I did not see this ingredient listed on the product page. This is just to advise those pet parents if your kiddo has a poultry or chicken allergy like mine do that every variety to date contains both chicken and natural chicken flavor.<br />The ingredients are as followed for the Gut Health variety<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Organic brown rice powder, rice powder, vegetable glycerin, gelatin, water, tapioca starch, oat fiber, chicken, natural chicken flavor, organic flaxseed, calcium carbonate, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), parsley, chia seed, cinnamon, ginger, peppermint, bacillus coagulans."
21450,B002QWP89S,Great Value=Happy Dogs,We ordered this after paying pet store prices for greenies for our 5 dogs and this has been a godsend! Larger container and affordable price I would be remiss to ever get them anywhere else again!
450088,B0000CH39R,Misrepresentation,The problem is not with the candy. Amazon pictures a christmas box but instead you get the regular white box.
7786,B000E1BM16,Fantastic deal!,"For coffee drinkers who buy Maxwell House coffee, this is a deal!  Buy two cases for just over $50!  Free shipping, too!  Seriously, you know I stocked up!"
169092,B000FBOA5K,Nutrition info update,"The nutrition info given online does not match that on the box when the product arrived.  According to the box total fat = .5 g, sodium = 40 mg, total carbs = 12g, fiber = 4g (not 7g), protein = 2g."
24836,B000G0EP78,Waste of Money,I've tried 3 different recipes with Carbquik.  I used it to bread chicken- just barely ok.  The biscuits I tried were terrible.  The dumplings for chicken and dumplings were a mess.  They didn't hold together when I put them in the boiling chicken broth to cook.  I had to pitch the doughy mess and order dinner out.  The mix its self has a peculiar odor that is unappetizing.  I wouldn't recommend buying this product.
504354,B004YGQPAK,Sugar sucker pills,"These are nothing but sugar pills, although with three kinds of sugar, and with some vitamins:<br /><br />Calories: 20<br />Total Carb: 5g<br />Sugars: 5g<br />Vitamin A: 1%<br />Vitamin C 33%<br />Vitamin B6: 33%<br />Vitamin B12: 33%<br /><br />Ingredients: Sugar, corn Syrup, Honey, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, Vitamin C.<br /><br />They don't taste like honey to me, so I can imagine having these around for emergencies, but not for daily use."
6639,B001LG945O,Artificial tasting,I didn't like this carbonated juice.  Although it appears to be all juice (not artificial flavors) it tastes somewhat artificial.  Perhaps it tastes more like canned orange juice (which tastes NOTHING like REAL orange juice)!  I fully expected to like this as I do like fizzy fruit juice drinks.  This one did not do it for me.
246170,B0009F3SBY,Save some for me!!!!,I am absolutely addicted to this tea!!! I made the mistake of sharing a cup with my neighbor. She now comes over to ask for a glass of my tea everytime she see's I am home. Oooops! I have to have it all day or the crankies come out!!! It is my cup of happiness! Thank you! Keep it coming!
5086,B001EO5ZFQ,Tasty!,Great sauce! Used in many Jamaican restaurants to help with the heat of the jerk seasoning. Most use Walkerwood jerk seasoning to make the jerk and pour this on later on the jerk or the rice.
334227,B001HTKZDA,Are they kidding??,You can pick up a 2-pack of these Arrowhead 2.5 Gallon waters for $4.49 at Costco and these guys want over $50 ?? What is going on...??
213646,B0046H30M8,Nutritional Content,"Did not know until I received this item and looked on the back of the bag, but this product is loaded with trans fats!<br />Wish I could return it!"
30812,B007M83302,Naturally nasty,I don't care if they're natural and not fried. The taste is odd and the texture is like packing material.
1138,B002OHOC6A,Great deal,My cats love this food. For the money it is a great product. I get it every month.  The cats love the flavor.
21017,B002QWP89S,Wrong size,"I ordered the GREENIES 'PETITE' size for my dogs, as I have done many times  before thru Amazon.  This time however, the WRONG size greenies arrived.  The thing is, the box DID say it was the PETITE size on it!  After I opened the box, I found that it was the next size up and too big for my dogs to eat.  Now I have to try & cut these stinkers with a scissors each day!  I'm NOT happy...but I couldn't return them as I had opened the package.<br />I am afraid to order more, as the entire batch that Amazon has, may ALL be MIS-labled!"
7410,B0002Q1X6C,"No taste, no smell","This is not what one should expect from a black truffle, but we are not paying the price for a winter truffle. It is cheap, but there is a reason for that: there is no taste and no smell at all. I was disappointed when I tried this truffle, but I realized that the price was that for a reason. At least it can be used to add a colour to your dish."
168748,B005PANYEY,Works great,I have been using Cytomax for years now for cycling. You do not eat anything and just drink the Cytomax and never run out of energy. You will not get sore or cramp during or after your exercise.
62453,B001EO5Y70,Not authentic,I have received these as gifts. The originals that come from Turkey do not come sopped in sugar.<br />They are placed in a tray that resembles an ice tray. This product came wrapped in paper and tasted nothing like the ones I have had in the past. I unfortunately bought a 4 pack and had to give the other 3 packs away. They did not taste good at all.
389954,B001PMCDK2,The only treat my picky cat likes,"I picked some of these up at Trader Joe's while I was on a visit to Santa Fe.  Over the last 10 years, I have found almost no treats that my cat likes.  She loves these, though!  She ""begs"" for them.  I bought several bottles on my last trip because I can't find them anywhere in Denver.  I hope that Amazon carries these again soon!!"
54985,B000IHJEDE,Yummm - If You Don't Have Sodium Concerns!,"These little cheese crisps taste like toasted cheese.  My favourite part of making anything with melted cheese is the little bits that get brown and crunchy - and that's what these taste like.  They are low in carbs and anyone who is on a low carb diet knows that once in a while you crave a crunchy snack.  They are salty, but I don't eat anything else that is high in sodium so I figure a 2 oz bag isn't going to hurt me."
6610,B002BRC562,Great stuff,I use Honey Stinger Energy chews on all my long distance bike rides.  I ride over 100 miles a week and love all the different flavors.
1173,B001HTI226,Ok,"These arent diced, its just mush, But I like the no bpa and would buy again for that reason- but dont expect diced."
37408,B000FBO9LK,These cookies are $2.19 in my SuperMarket,We were buying Bahlsen cookies at $1.70-$2.19 at lockal supermarket until I found that they are $1.41/box here at Amazon!

22149,B000KV61FC,Not for people with hardwood floors,"Our dog does enjoy this toy, but the constant slamming on our wood floors is annoying. The rubber part actually lasted a month, which is a record for our chewer."
4973,B0061YK3O2,Simply the best olive oil from the best source,"I'm a little biased in my review, but I firmly believe that Mt. Kofinas extra virgin olive oil is the best olive oil you can buy. It has the best blend of flavor and low acidity that I've tastes anywhere. I've tastes olive oils that say they have .1 acidity levels, but then they don't taste like anything at all. I've also tastes olive oils that claim all sorts of awards that have made me have a coughing fit from their pepperiness. Here's what I think: it's all about the flavor, and Mt. Kofinas simply tastes the best. Also, since it's sources from one area, I'm not worried about any other oils being in my delicious extra virgin olive oil.<br /><br />If you want to taste some truly delicious olive oil that doesn't cost a lot, try Mt. Kofinas olive oil."
66614,B0000SY9U4,Inferior Coffee,"Aloha Island Coffee Company Bonzai Pipeline Dark Roast is a very mediocre, insipid coffee, rather acidic for a dark roast. The beans are of unknown origin, but if there are any Kona beans in this anonymous mix, they must be the ones other roasters threw out as it doesn't even vaguely taste like Kona. Actually, Aloha Island Coffee Co. isn't even in Hawaii, it's located in Santa Ana, CA, an area not exactly known for great coffee. The coffee is extremely overpriced for the poor quality you get, which is why I gave it one star, and you would be better off buying some of the better brands commonly sold in supermarkets at about one-third the price. I ordered the 2-8 oz bags, but I couldn't even make it through the first one and have thrown the second in the garbage. I would never buy anything from Aloha Island Coffee company again."
78254,B006ACQYB6,I like it,i put it in a glass jar for chow watmore ken i talk about it is pink salt i resifet it fest
6584,B002BRC562,I use them for marathons,"I can't stand GU anymore so i found these.  For me, i feel like i got much more energy and so much better tasting.  These taste as good as any gummi candy out there.  Sometimes during the week i'll open a package and eat a few every day before my workout, and i really notice the extra energy towards the end of the workout."
25366,B000EH2QP6,BEWARE!  Picture is not what you get!,"My westie and yorkie eat this canned food and I thought I might find it slightly less expensive on Amazon.<br />I found this one and saw the picture of the large dog food which is normally what I buy at the pet store.  It appeared cheaper by a little after considering the shipping cost.<br />I was very disappointed in finding out after shipping cost I actually paid .54 cents more than my pet store!  But then it was worse!!! The cans were more than half the size of the picture!  I contacted customer service and told them I should have read the description, however, the picture was of the larger can.  They offered a return, I would have been stupid again to pay $16+ total in shipping to and from to get a $14 credit.<br />I told customer service the picture was misleading and she said she wasn't sure on this product, but in the past they've told Amazon they have wrong pictures on certain items and Amazon does nothing about it! I don't know if it was their fault or Amazon's fault, but I do know I paid DOUBLE!  I have purchased a lot of items on Amazonb and this is the first time I've felt CHEATED."
3060,B0043JF3II,Not particularly good,"I've had many types of pepper jelly, and this is by far the worst ever. The price is high, and the taste is not good. The shipping was outrageous. More costly than the green pepper jelly. Don't waste you money."
30411,B003X7S45U,NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!!!,"The smell of this coffee was nasty. I thought maybe the taste will be a little better, WRONG! Honestly, do not waste your hard earned money on this one."
150325,B00355CLLS,My twins hates it!,"I wouldn't say my twins are picky eater, but they wouldn't eat this one.  They eat just about every Gerber's organics."
151511,B001EQ5O4G,Starbucks is better when you buy at the store,"I buy the best pre-ground on the spot coffee from my Starbucks, we have 3 locations in a town with 200,000 people.  The coffee that is on Amazon is SOOOOO expensive.  I pay around $11.00 for this coffee and have it ground in the store.  Why is this so expensive here on Amazon?"
3821,B000X2CWTM,good traditional licorice,"love it. eating it has got to be a ritual. taste is well balanced, nice and chewy without being overly sticky, leave a great lingering aftertaste.<br /><br />compared to gimbal's scottish dogs, these taste and feel more traditional, and much healthier too, given that only four ingredients go into them.<br /><br />out in the midwest, ann abor to be specific, i found these in the candy aisle for around $2.80 per resealable bag of 170g."
42325,B0014EQHK8,I gave it away!,"This soup is very disappointing. It doesn't taste like wonton soup at all, more like a very bland chicken noodle without the noodles! Someone needs to make a good canned wonton soup... progresso? Please!"
523581,B000CFK1XY,Best Stuff on the Planet!!!!,I can not survive without my Fox's Ubet Syrup!!! It brings me back to NY!!
8532,B003VXFK44,Wolfgang Puck Sumatra,I ordered this by accident and I'm so happy I did. This is a new favorite of mine. It's nice and strong without being bitter.
40871,B007OWP35Y,LOVE THESE!!!!,"I discovered Chimes Ginger Chews a few months ago and I am hooked!  I have also gotten a few other people hooked.  I like the original and peanut butter ginger chews also but these are by far my favorites...will be ordering these again, and again, and again...:-D"
5416,B00622CYVS,One of Our Favorite Variety Packs,I love Earth's Best. My son eats almost all of the Earth's Best single and combination foods. This pack in particular has two of his dinner/lunch favorites: Summer Vegetable and Brown Rice and Lentil. Some of the dinners and a lot of the first purees are very runny so we mix with some cereal to thicken.
443982,B00549DHG6,Bait and Switch,We ordered Hawaiian Host individually Wrapped Boxes (Pack of 6) (7 oz per box / 42 oz total weight) in scenic CARRYING GIFT BOX. We recieved 6 5oz boxes made by Mauna Loa. This looks like a bait and switch scam.
31174,B007M83302,"OK, but not fabulous","The seasoning is too heavy. I will eat them, but only because I ordered a bunch."
4355,B004391DK0,Amazing!,"We have been living gluten-free for 5 years now, and this mix is the best I have found!  It makes great waffles."
166786,B0019O1FWS,El mejor aceite para comida asiatica,"Este es el mejor aceite que he usado desde que cocino comida asiatica, el lijero y no se quema facilmente cuando pones comida a temperatura muy alta, y tiene un olor que despierta tu apetito inmediatamente.<br />Llego perfectamente empacado y felicito a los distribuidores por tener este producto de primera calidad."
5126,B0028VAQSU,gluten free in Talent,"I have a cafe in Talent , Oregon.  I couldnt find this product wholesale anywhere. This is so convienient and free shipping and it was here in just a few days!!  My supplier could only get small amounts of inferior product and it would take 3 weeks. Thanks Amazon!"
4501,B002TMV3E4,Nothing Special,"I have a pretty wide appreciation for acceptable coffee, but in my opinion, this stuff is mediocre coffee. I drink both regular and decaf on a daily basis and to me, this tasted like institutional cafeteria coffee. I am normally a fan of the ""Swiss water decaffeination process"" decaf coffees, and was disappointed by the quality of this ""gourmet"" coffee.<br /><br />With that said, I did try this twice to give it a fair review. The first time I prepared it the same way I normally make my coffee (on the strong side), the second time I followed the directions exactly. Both times using filtered water and a quality coffee maker that uses the Melitta style (cone) filter. To my taste, it was stale and over-ground (like the flavor was watered out of it and then over-roasted and ground extra fine to try and put some flavor back into it), comparable in quality to low-end bulk coffee. The brands of decaf coffee I do like and brew at home (Dunkin' and Newman's Own, to name only two) are in the same price range, and also purchased pre-ground, but to me taste much smoother, and more full-flavored. This coffee is not one I would make a point to purchase when there are better coffee choices for the same money -or cheaper coffee choices for the same quality."
5604,B000G1X45G,If you love strong full flavored coffee---this is for you--the Best!,"If you like strong coffee, this is it!  The flavor is exceptional, I have not found better in a can.  This can be expensive and difficult to find at your local store.  I have had great luck with Amazon, good price for the subscription order (you can get a case a couple times a year and still get the reduced rate).  Amazon also has a wonderful return policy!<br />Try Yuban if you love strong coffee and have not found the coffee for you, this may be it!  We have been drinking it for 10+ years now & have had the Original, Organic and Dark Roast---I dont have a preference, they are all excellent."
7441,B005HVDZRM,mmmm good tea,I am so happy to have found a wonderful decaf tea for myself and guests. This tea is nice and full flavored and has a very smooth finish. I usually use the K-cup twice on xl setting and the tea remains true and delicious. The price is the best i have found anywhere
4138,B001EW5YQS,AWESOME! BUY FOR SURE!,"I bought the ICICLE because I have been doing a lot of hip-hop vocals and I was using a Samson C01U and the thing with that Mic you can get close to studio but with so much work and you can always tell that you messed with it alot.<br /><br />Well I always wanted to buy a expensive Mic but didnt want to spend $200 more on a USB Pre-Amp so I see this on here the other day and went to Guitar Center and after deciding for a while I went with it. I also already had a MXL V-88 which is a pretty high end condenser mic, although now you can find it for cheap but original RSPV=$700 and average selling price after it being out was $349-400. But I am very happy.<br /><br />I use Reaper to record vocals with a ASIO driver (AND IT DOES WORK WITH MY ASIO DRIVER) someone put in their comment that it doesnt. For those of you that arnt familure with ASIO it is a driver/program that runs and samples your audio going in, you basically use it with anything that is MIDI or MIDI/MIC to USB. It makes your audio not lag and sound more professional. Also for the people that said the volume was too low, go into Sound in windows and turn the mic up a little, I keep mine on 5%. Also your recording program will let you turn up while your monitoring the record or after.<br /><br />GO AHEAD AND BUY ONE!"
3048,B004NNFEA6,Snyder's Best Flavor,"I was starting to think that Snyder and I just didn't share the same idea about what's good in snack flavors. I have tried several of their other pretzel pieces flavors (Buffalo Wing and Honey Mustard) and was very disappointed. I have to say, that these Cheddar Cheese flavor pieces are not just good, but spectacularly good! They have a very rich, buttery cheese flavor with pleasant yeasty aftertaste. These are totally addictive. It's very easy to munch through the entire large bag in one setting."
202549,B000FRXO6U,Only bought it,Bought it for the ice cream maker which did not make ice cream since then sitting in the fridge.
57235,B00817GPWQ,Good but not great.,This selection was somewhat of a disappointment. The taste was good but it could have been a little stronger to suit me. The flavor is just a little too subtle.
28571,B0089SPEO2,Disappointing flavor,"This tea smells good, but my entire family doesn't like the flavor.  It just doesn't seem to work and tastes terrible.  What a shame, since I really like the idea of this tea.  Just had to throw the box out!"
49141,B0029O0XGQ,Cat treats,My kitty loves these treats and can't get enough of them.  He loves them so much and a friend of mine has a kitty also and I gave her some for her kitty and now her kitty is addicted to them.
149265,B000FUOC86,Great Chews,After spending $600 on a dental cleaning(the Vet needs to knock out the dog to preform the procedure) I asked the Doctor what could be done to eliminate any future cleanings.  The two suggestions were to brush the dogs teeth or use these Enzadent Chews.  Option two was my choice.  The Vet charged $18 per bag.  Amazon had then for $12 (including shipping).  Same product...2/3 the price.
71129,B002PI82P0,A waste of money--a lemon!,"I am from Italy and own a machine from this brand there. The machine over there works. The one I bought here in the USA broke after 8 months. I had to pay all the shipping costs for them to fix it, and they sent it back and it worked for a few more months. But now it broke again and it is no longer under warranty! There is not anyone in the entire state that services it, so I am stuck with a broken $500 machine. Not worth it at ALL!!! Don't buy it, the customer service is awful and the machine is not built to last."

33149,B000SATIZA,"Fast Service, Great Tasting Product","I ordered the hibiscus tea based on information that drinking two cups per day would help reduce blood pressure.  I have not been to the doctor yet to see if this working.  The product arrived promptly.  I drink two cups per day sweetened with a little stevia.  My only critical comment would be that<br />the packaging doesn't give instructions for preparing the tea, such as how<br />long it should steep.  I have been steeping it for five minutes.  If that is too long or too short of a time I hope someone will let me know!"
47096,B000H27NY2,"Warning, contains mono and digltcerides. Be Careful.","I initially purchased this soup because it is not packaged in a can with the carcinogen BPA, or Bisphenol A. BPA is especially bad for men since it acts as estrogen. So bear creek chicken noodle soup seemed safe. Well I found out after consuming this soup that the food industry only has to report trans fat content from triglycerides--not from monoglycerides or diglycerides. But trans fats are inevitably formed in when mono- and diglycerides are manufactured. Since bear creek soup contains both monoglycerides and diglycerides, there is in fact trans fat in the soup. So basically it is perfectly legal to say any food product does not contain trans fat when in fact it does contain trans fat. In addition to being able to put as much as 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving, not in the entire package but per serving and rounding down to zero the food industry has pulled another one over consumers. So before you or your children consume any product with monoglycerides and/or diglycerides, do some research about their dangers to your health."
108458,B00411ZIKG,kinda gross,"I dunno about you, but one of my favorite things when eating skittles is to combine the flavors to create different taste combinations. Unfortunately when doing so with this set of flavors the achieved result is the flavor of gag-inducing cough medicine. yuck."
23719,B0013NUGDE,Pop Chips are awesome,Taste is similar to regular potato chips but without the guilt of eating something so bad for you.  They make a great snack.  Bags are a little lite but if you eat a couple of bags it should satisfy.
8477,B003VXFK44,Love this creamy coffee,"This is my favorite KCup.  I'd describe it as medium-dark, creamy and rich.  And very consistent.  A lot of k-cups seem acidic to me, so i'm really glad i found this one. :]"
37097,B002IVDAH4,Fabulous!,My cat has pancreatitis and projectile vomits any food other than this one.  I would pay any price for this...worth its weight in gold.
293463,B008MUOR9K,A.O.K.,Tastes just like the wasabi in stores and restaurants. You get about twice the amount<br />of product for the money than in the stores. Grocery shopping by  internet has a future.
2535,B000G7UDPY,Unlisted ingredient of Baxter Lobster Bisque,"This soup is very good tasting if you like seafood, like I do. I am finally finishing my case of cans, because it is good food. However, I do not plan on getting any more of this particular product because every can has a little something extra: bits and pieces of chitinous shell, mostly from the shrimp but also a few hard pieces now and then from the lobster. They are small pieces, which means taking small spoonfuls and not biting down hard on anything, and don't eat the last spoonful. I find six to eight pieces of this debris in each can. Like I said before, I am finishing the case, because it is food and pretty good at that. But I just don't appreciate having to be that careful with my soup."
6545,B003DKY5R8,Great tea,"Great tea...I have checked other stores ie: Target, Kohls and they are more than this tea costs plus the boxes you get on Amazon are bigger quanities."
480170,B001FWXLYE,SHIRO MISO,"Arrived on schedule, in promised condition. Now I can have tasty homemade miso soup. For that I give it 5 stars."
193,B004V6AH34,Tastes Great. Arrived in 2 days!,"Tastes great, and gives me energy without the jitters. Love this product.<br />However, I do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a zip-lock pouch because the zip-lock ripped off and quit working after awhile. But the product is fantastic, just not crazy about the packaging."
60265,B001ELL3LY,Good for baking (with a little trick),"I use Organic Valley Nonfat Dry Milk Powder for baking bread regularly. However, there is one simple rule you have to follow every time you bake with it. You need to always mix it thoroughly with other dry ingredients before you mix in the wet ingredients. Otherwise, you will get little hard lumps of dry milk that will never dissolve no matter how long you work on it. The consistency of the lumps is almost like raw rice that has been soaked in water. So, regardless what you bake, just remember to mix the milk powder with the rest of the dry ingredients very well. Even a little mount of milk powder that's missed in the mixing will give you some hard lumps. Mixing it in advance with water or other wet ingredients is not a good answer either. That's what happened to me when I tried to reconstitute it to the equivalent of a cup of liquid milk when I used it for the first time (my recipe calls for liquid milk). I ended up throwing 3 tablespoon of it and started over. I can't imagine how some people can use it for drinking or in coffee without having to chew or swallow lumps all the time. I can understand it for shakes or smoothies. If you have tips of how to reconstitute it free of lump, please share it."
27758,B002RBTV78,Lindor Truffles,"I ordered two-60 count boxes for the candy table at my daughter's wedding, knowing that these would be the ultimate! When we opened the box, the truffles were puckered, and chocolate was inside of the ends of the wrappers.  Some so badly (about 27-28), that I could not put them into the candy jar to take to the venue. The rest were still puckered with indentations on them. But I tried to pick the least worst ones. I opened some up to see how they taste because of the bad quality of them, in wrapped form. They did taste amazing as usual. What an embarrassment at a $30,000 plus venue. I sent an email to Sue""s Shirt Shop and More (seller through Amazon). They informed me that they were perfect at time of shipment, but wanted the order number. On October 3, I provided them the info and told them they were by far not perfect when received, that I did not have them in any heat (that I was home at time of delivery) and wondered how could they tell me they were in perfect condition at time of shipment unless they themselves physically inspected each one. As of this date, I have not heard back. I do know that we paid $10.98 for shipping and handling and would think that USPS was not responsible for their condition; however, only Amazon.com would know that. The issue of shipping never came up. But in the end, the customer (us) got the shaft. For the price we paid, we could have bought each piece individually in a local shop. Unfortunately, we did not know this would happen. I would never order these again, online. We did it because it was the only way to buy boxes of them.  omg, I have now first read other reviews and find that ours, too, did not have the shiny, crisp covering that they normally have. And, yes, there were chocolate stains on the inside of the box they came in. Just like in other orders. I now see that I am not alone in having the problems of quality being far under par. I just wish mine would have been of the correct quality so that it didn't leave a bad impression on the candy table at our daughter's wedding, which was otherwise elegant. Then again, hopefully, it reflected on the quality of Lindor truffles themselves. All I know is that someone should be very concerned. I feel like these were the rejects of their product. And, they probably were..."
187413,B000FDMLUE,Interesting mix,"I used this mix twice to make gingerbread in my bread machine.  As mix is OU parve, I used almond milk.  The mix is probably tastier using milk."
508790,B002RAZWDG,Best Buffalo Jerky assorted pack,Every Christmas this item is on our son's Xmas list - You get to sample quite a variety of jerky
56600,B0012XBD7I,Maybe the worst chips ever.,"These are perhaps the worst chips that have ever gone into my mouth.<br /><br />For my entire life Sour Cream & Onion (and in this case ""& Chive"") chips were my favorite. Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.<br /><br />I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them. Hopefully they'll reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips."
34976,B002DLXXHG,"Tender as promised, but more salt and gristle than bargained for","By now I've eaten half the bag so I know what's in here. Sure, their beef jerky is pretty tender. But for some reason they decided to throw in an insane amount of salt. I've had store-bought beef jerky and I've had quality Amazon beef jerky and this is definitely the saltiest by at least double. The first time I ate this, I could only handle 2 strips before I had to put it down again. My friend made a disgusted face and refused to have another bite. Luckily I am a salt lover so I can at least tolerate the extreme saltiness. But it's still too salty.<br /><br />Next up is the gristle. Sometimes amidst the generally tender bites there will be a mat of unchewable mass that I pretty much have to spit out or swallow whole. It happens more often than other brands and definitely more than I care for. Secondly, I don't know if it's the salt playing tricks on me, but the texture and taste is a bit worse than other brands, like they use lower quality jerky.<br /><br />Overall I believe that Wild Ride is less quality than most other brands, even when you factor in the low price. There are similarly priced brands that are of higher quality and lower sodium content. I don't know why they sell so well. Personally my next bulk order beef jerky will be with someone else."
13230,B0038RLIYO,Not very tasty,"I tried it, but I just didn't like it.  Not a good tasting sugar substitute in my opinion.  I'd rather do without sugar than use this again."
13501,B002MXSAD2,Lid was chipped but I like the product,Came to me with a chipped lid.  I wrote an email to the company to see what I could do and no one responded.
34928,B002DLXXHG,Salty and dry!,"Compared to Pacific Gold beef jerky, this beef jerky is way too salty! You have to drink a glass of water for every piece of jerky you eat.  It's also a littler drier and less tender than other beef jerky.  I would recommend trying other brands of beef jerky and staying away from this unless you want to develop early high blood pressure."
59678,B000W5SLB8,False Labeling!,"The package says buffalo and venison, yet on the ingredients buffalo is number one, then chicken, then lamb.  Venison is way down on the list now.  Apparently, Taste of the Wild is owned by Diamond Pet Foods.  Yes the same Diamond Pet Foods that had their food recalled, where they were using a toxic chemical.  If you lookup Diamond Pet Foods on Amazon you will see that they use lower quality ingredients and none of their foods are in the same league as Wellness or Blue Buffalo.<br /><br />My problem with this food is that they used to use buffalo and venison as the top 2 ingredients, as the label indicates, but now they use chicken and lamb to cheapen the product.  Buyer Beware!"
4710,B00139TT72,Great dog food,We have been feeding our dog Newman's Own since she was very young.  She was a finiky eater and I was a determined owner who insisted on organic food.  Both of our needs were fulfilled when we found this great product.  It's the only dog food that she has eaten and she is going to be 9 years old next month.  The only reason she ever has gone to the vet is for her shots.  I highly recommend this food....I am SOOO glad amazon carries it now because we had to drive quite a distance to buy it before at a organic pet shop.....
2779,B000J2DQ46,"Bar Harbor All Natural New England Clam Chowder, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)",This is our preferred clam chowder . We like the natural taste with lots of potatoes. The only complaint is I think the soup can be creamier. Amazon has much better price on this with subscribe and save.
41248,B00427ZLOC,"Great quality,cats love it","My big boy (21.6 lbs) was put on an all-meat diet and he LOVES this food. It is a little less solid (slightly soupy) but my cats love that about it. They even eat all the little veggie pieces in it. Our feral deck cat leaves the peas behind, though.  It's hilarious. If it wasn't so darn expensive, I would buy more of it."
1232,B005O072PC,Stuffed Baked Potatoes,These potatoes are very good along with all their steaks and hamburgers.  I would definately recommend Omaha Steaks to anyone looking for a gourmet dinner at a reasonable price!
4348,B004391DK0,Makes great biscuits!,Made really great biscuits; even my non-GF husband enjoyed them!  My only complaint would be that the packages aren't very big; I used 2 cups to make a batch of biscuits and I don't think there's even 1 cup left in the package.
76223,B000H25WXG,So good!,"I never get tired of mint chocolate cocoa! Can be pricey, try to catch when on sale or shop around Amazon's vendors for the lowest price. Quick turnaround when ordering, never been disappointed and I order ALOT!"
80713,B000MXHQR0,Not environmentally friendly!,"Unfortunately, Gerber is using tuna oil as a source of DHA. This is very bad for the environment - tuna is severely over-fished and people should not really be eating tuna at all. They should switch to a plant- or algae-based source of DHA. Until then, I suggest that you avoid this product if you care about the environment. By the way, a fish-based source of DHA does have a higher chance of being contaminated by toxic chemicals like mercury. This is one of the reasons why people seeking higher DHA levels in their diet have switched to plant-based sources such as flaxseed oil."
5824,B002HFRYZ0,Very good tea!,The tea tastes great hot or iced.  Very good for the price.  I recieved the package fast with no problems.
20596,B004U8Z436,"Great litter, a little dusty","This litter is firm clumping, long lasting, and by ordering the subscription, it's one 40-lb item I don't have to lug home from the store! It's a little (just a little) dusty, but less dusty than other litters we've tried."

60245,B004R9EKT2,Really bad!,"Love the Feridies peanuts and pistachios, however, this snack mix is a major disappointment.  Stale tasting, uninteresting and visually unappealing.  Too bad the remaining three cans cannot be returned!"
49346,B000IHNCQO,Good dog treats,"I was really disappointed when I opened my box of snacks yesterday. This product claimed to be pure cheese and even says it contains no MSG when in fact it has autolyzed yeast, maltodextrin and yeast extract. For those who don't know those are just synonyms for MSG but they hide it under any name they can. Check out the site www.msgmyth.com."
29834,B001E6EE92,Yummy cereal,My husband started eating this in SC and became addicted.  When we went to Maine for the summer we couldn't get it at our local grocery store. Luckily I can buy it through Amazon to tide us over.

25213,B000FZRYPO,Great for dieters!,"I am on weight watchers and these noodles allow me to have pasta for half the points!  I like them.  If you are picky about your pasta these may not be for you, they are just a little different.  They don't have the different shapes of pasta and to me the texture is ""al dente""  I like them though and once I finish my six bags I will be buying them again."
39311,B0031VBGX0,Tastes more like spinach than pears,"I was hoping the pears would mask the spinach and peas flavor, but it does not and my daughter doesn't care for it."
10620,B004GU3YXU,There are still shells/husks in the bag,"I bought these based on another review from the other product, the Nutiva hempseeds 3 pack stating that those hempseeds have crunchy husks in it and these do not.  I also based my purchase on all the great reviews on this product here.  I was expecting just the white hearts of the hempseeds, sort of like when you buy shelled sunflower seeds.  When I opened the package I was severely disappointed.  It was white with black bits all over the place.  I'll upload a picture when I get the chance, it looked like dirt.  I gave it a taste and it felt like small bits of glass crunching in my mouth, it was absolutely repugnant.  Maybe I received a bad batch, who knows?  I am not here to put off other potential buyers, just telling my story on my purchase.  I'm going to try another product because I really want to add Hempseeds to my diet."
41227,B00427ZLOC,Kitty is in love!,"This stuff looks disgusting, it really does. It's like meat soup that has been pureed. My cat goes nuts for it. She chirps her tiny cat meow at me whenever I get up in the morning and when I come home from work. I put her dry food in, that she used to love (will definitely switch to Spot's Stew dry next time I buy) and she looks at me like I'm evil. All she wants now is her succulent salmon."
19676,B0030VBRIU,Try Before You Buy in Bulk,"My son is not a picky eater, but he really doesn't like this flavor.  I love the HappyBaby brand in general and so does my son, who is 11 months old.  I'm not saying this is a bad product, but I definitely would not buy it in bulk before you let your child try it.  You are much safer doing that with the fruit/veggie mixes.  Try before you buy seems like common sense.  However, the only store that carries this brand locally for me (Target) has a very limited selection so I couldn't let my son try this flavor before I bought it.  I imagine that is the same for other people shopping on-line.  I thought I could mix it with something else if he didn't care for it, but he will have nothing to do with it, mixed or otherwise.  I have to say that I agree with another review that says it looks & smells like cat food.  I try all of the food I feed my son and thought this product was bland, bordering on bad tasting.  I give it 3 stars, because I think this product is definitely not for everyone, and more of an acquired taste.  I highly recommend HappyBaby though!"
395740,B001IZJZE8,Awesome Flavor at a Great Price,"This is the way to go. Buy a package of 96 packets of Unsweetened Invisible Watermelon Kiwi Kool-Aid mix,so you don't run out,before Kraft Foods stops selling this flavor."
3116,B004JQVASM,Wonderful substitute...,"I struggle between giving this 3 or 4, even 5 stars - because I am just thankful for the substitute, as I have a condition that I need low acid coffee for. However, I DO have to admit, it tastes like burnt coffee (as someone else put it) and it is no Peets or Starbucks. The taste, and the flavor it leaves in your mouth after you are done, is something I don't think I will ever get used to.<br /><br />Update: I had my father in law up. Would like to say that if you are one, like he is, that puts mounds of creamer and sugar in your coffee...apparently you will not notice a difference in taste from this brand to another. Hope that helps!"

It should be going for about $4 a tin, not $12... It's just not ""finest grade"". I can tell, and I'm not even a crazy tea fanatic. You can get 50 grams of white peony tea for $7 at a place like Lupicia USA, and the difference in quality will be obvious... and that's not their finest stuff by a long shot."

Though the price is far cheaper than the Ten  Fu (Ten Ren) teas and other retailers, the discernment in quality seemed questionable. I am a simpleton concerning tea. So rather than purchase $90/kg for the base Assam tea, I went to Carre4 and bought an under $5/box of Lipton Yellow label Black tea 100 bags for the consistant quality."

There is a goo in the center that tastes like plain corn syrup only not sweet;  there is absolutely no liquor flavor to this product.  It resembles a stale cough drop at best....no kick, no zing,  no sweetness.  Yuck.  I will never buy this item again.  ( I checked the expiration and these don't expire until 2015 and if that's the best/freshness you achieve then forget this food item ) This is why this candy is just about 2 dollars a bag;  you pay for what you get. 2 thumbs down; save your money on another brand after dinner liquor candy."

6838,B001LG945O,Not My Thing; But You Might Enjoy,"Note: This is my first review of a product that is not a book, so please forgive me if I miss something.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of fruit drinks like The Switch, but I decided to go ahead and give it a shot. After having my first drink, I can honestly say I wanted to hate it. I mean, seriously, I'm drinking this can of 100% fruit juice with carbonation and reading all these really stupid quotes all over the can (i.e. ""100% of what I want in a soda, 0% of what I don't""), wondering how much a 8.3 ounce can of this junk costs (thinking somewhere in the neighborhood of $2.50 or $3.00; and thinking, if I wanted to drink some juice and would drink some juice! I couldn't stop thinking about what is so special about carbonation that I would want to drink this over a glass of OJ. I wanted to scream!<br /><br />However, I kept my cool, and finished the drink. There was something about this particular flavor that was enjoyable, but not engrossing. There was something in the aftertaste that I did not like, and I think it had to do with the tangerine juice. Tangerine's aren't my bag, either; but it was tolerable.<br /><br />After discussing this product with my wife (I know, this drink apparently also contains the conversation starter attributes, bonus points for that I suppose) she was like, ""this sounds great. Is it like those <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IW25RK"">Izze POMEGRANATE SPARKLING 100% JUICE DRINK</a>??"" I responded: ""Um.... I guess so...""<br /><br />I then also looked up the price and learned that I had grossly overestimated the price of a single can (being just over a single dollar). Despite my wanting to hate this product, I've decided to step out of my anti-contemporary culture box, view this product for what it is, and give it a middle rating of 3 stars.<br /><br />I can see the attraction; I can see the appeal; I just won't ever buy it. I'll stick to my glass of Orange Juice and Tang any day.<br /><br />Good drinking,<br /><br />J.Stoner"

I then blended it with chicken broth and she does eat it now, so it turned out to be a texture thing.

And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too.  They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.<br /><br />And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great."

They are made by a small company in NE that obviously care about the health of our pets.<br /><br />Another interesting comparison is the amount moisture and protein.  Milk Bone: 12% moisture, 15% protein.<br />  Beneful: 20% moisture, 14% protein.<br />  Raw Boost:  4% moisture 40% protein.<br /><br />Rather interesting I thought, we usually don't have time to check out what's in our pets food at the store, always in a hurry.  I just thought you might like look at this too.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the treats!  We have two min. schnauzers who always love their ""goodies""----and they are rather picky about their food.  The Raw Boost Bites passed with flying colors, so I (with tongue in cheek) think these are the ones that picky pets would choose.<br /><br />Would recommend this product to any pet lover."

Also, the caviar comes in a can like that of tuna fish or sardines. (Wish I would've known that before placing the order).<br /><br />The worst part of all is the mushy, bad-tasting mess that's inside...probably the result of its ingredients: salmon roe, salt, vegetable oil, sorbic acid.<br /><br />I am NOT happy with my order and feel I just threw money in the garbage.  The *reality* of the product bears *no resemblance* to the photo posted on Amazon.<br /><br />I have three cans of this stuff and don't know what to do with them.

3025,B000B9SFP2,Nicely thought out kit for temporary grazing etc,"This kit pulls together several standard components rather nicely. I am using it for supplemental grazing of horses, particularly to get small areas that are not permanently enclosed as pasture, but that get overgrown and/or delicious.<br /><br />I like it. Setup time, once you figure out the components, is about 15 minutes. It has all the pieces to make a very reasonable temporary electric corral - tape, posts, charger, ground, and gate hook.<br /><br />The 8 step-in posts are fairly standard: they have nice pointy metal stakes at the bottom that make them relatively easy to insert in moist ground. You probably can't get them into rock hard dry ground, but that's not a surprise. There are clips to give you flexibility in the fence height. But - you've probably seen them at the feed store - this kind of post is pretty short and will feel quite short compared to a normal horse fence.<br /><br />The kit is supposed to come with 200' of 1/2"" electric tape. Mine (as a Vine kit) only had 100'. This is enough for one very well behaved horse in a 25x25 square. The tape is not much of a visual barrier, especially with only one strand. This is not a fence I'd trust for a problem horse or for long unattended periods. 200' would be enough for either two strands or to have a 50x50 square and would be a much better value of time spent to grazing time. 50 x 50 is still quite small and the fence is still not substantial. It would be straightforward to add tape, but adding distance also increases the load on the charger.<br /><br />The product description says 4-5 horses. I would not feel safe doing that. Two quiet horses who know each other well and are already familiar with electric fence, maybe three for very brief periods, if you had the 50 x 50 and were nearby or had a secure outer fence. For grazing, three horses would have the area mowed in just a couple of hours.<br /><br />The charger - which uses 2 D batteries - has plenty of zap new. I was pleased by how easy it was to work with. It has its own spike, allowing you to set it up away from the fence.  The connections are long enough that you can put it out of nose range. The grounding nail was easy to set up and pull out.<br /><br />I like that it comes with a simple corner bracing system. You can set it up without the corner braces, depending upon how tight you like your fence and how stiff the ground is. But when you need the braces, you're glad to have the option.<br /><br />The tape comes on a handy small spinning jenny, which is designed to hang on the fence when it is installed. It's a simple thing, and thoughtfully done. It makes it easy to unroll the fence when setting up, and easy to reroll when putting it away. There is no problem doing the whole setup and takedown by yourself.<br /><br />The hook for the gate isn't quite a match for the brackets on the posts. A little bigger hook, or some sort of metal bracket, would be nice, to give a sense of a more secure latch. Still, you're counting on the fence never being touched, so it's not a big problem.<br /><br />The bag for the kit is amazing. Everything fits inside beautifully, with thoughtful pockets - even a special pocket for the instructions. It is easy to carry and extremely organized. I was very impressed to see the thought and effort put into the bag, which makes the kit much easier to use and deal with than just a pile of fence parts. The bag is big enough that there is room for extra items in both the long post compartment and the smaller bag section.<br /><br />This is a very nice and handy kit to have around if you have quiet horses that respect electric fence."
14689,B000DZKKK2,Not quite as advertised,"The ingredients shown on Pamela's website did not show any corn in the mix.  The package lists corn derivatives in the mix.  My grandson is allergic to corn, so this is a problem."
6839,B001LG945O,"This is really good, especially if you like 100% juice","I really enjoyed this drink.  It tasted just like an orange soda, but I liked it more because it was 100% juice, and didn't have any extra additives.<br /><br />The only negative is that since it is 100% juice (and has no artificial sweeteners) it is high in calories -140 calories to a can, to be exact.<br /><br />However, if I were to choose between drinking this or drinking an apple or orange juice, I definitely would drink this as a treat.  Plus, it would be really fun to pack in a cooler, especially for the young ones in your family.<br /><br />Please note, it is not just a single type of juice.  It is a blend of several juices, so it is not ""carbonated OJ"", it is something just a little different."

Even though I just received a bag yesterday, I ordered two more today, and some Newman's Own cat food.  What other retailer would automatically do that for you .. none that I know of.

Runs solely off USB (No need for a wall wart).<br /><br />Cons: Very plastic. Feels like it could snap with the slightest bit of rough handling! I wouldn't try to plug it directly into a mic. Use an XLR cable. No headphone monitoring jack and quite a bit of latency when monitoring with a separate interface. I would not recommend it for Dynamic mics. I tried it with my Rode Procaster Dynamic Mic and could not get high enough levels without practically yelling into the mic. I also tried it with an old V-Tech handheld stage mic and levels were a little better, so dynamics with a higher line output might work better with it.<br /><br />Overall, it does what it's supposed to, but it could be a lot better. For about $30-40 more, you can get better interfaces with 2 mic inputs, but this one is nice for situations where running off of USB power is a must."
72453,B001J8RW94,Kitten loves it,"Our kitten loves this food, and it doesn't upset her tummy like the Wellness Kitten food did. I would recommend it!"
6439,B000R4DWC2,Wonderful Cheese,Ordered this goat cheese and it is just fantastic! I can't digest cow milk so finding these goat cheeses was a great treat! I would order them again they are that delicious! Looks spectacular on a cheese platter with fruit and selected crackers.
81595,B001EQ4RBM,Full of flavor,"To start I should say I HATE Almonds. I don't dislike them, I hate them (and I have tried all manner of almonds, from raw to various flavors). A former co-worker brought a huge jug of these to work and urged me to give one a try. Like the stubborn child who refuses to eat her veggies, I popped one in my mouth, with a large glass of water in hand to wash down what I expected to be the awful (to me) flavor. I was shocked to find I not only didn't object to these, but became hooked on them in short order.<br /><br />I have been unable to find this flavor in the mega jug my co-worked purchased at a big box retailer over a year ago and was pleased to find this option on Amazon for a price lower than my local grogery store. I wish that big jug were available, but these smaller cans probably assure a fresher product.<br /><br />I will add, that I am a big fan of vinegar, but am not a big fan of salt and vinegar chips. These almonds have an excellent balance of flavor."
1971,B000X61Y60,Nice condiment,"I bought this because my husband wanted to try the French sea salt as it was recommended on a cooking show.  The grinding mechanism works well and he seems to like it.  I did not realize, however, that it is not ""iodized"" and that may be a concern for some folks who need to make sure they take in enough daily iodine."
4401,B000GPKI10,I Felt Like A Thief When I Bought These!,"What a steal!  I make a lot of Gingerbread Cookies during the holidays - large ones - over 6"" long - and I bag them in florist corsage bags.  They look like you bought them at a fancy store.  These decorations are the best and they are so cheap."
22519,B001YJBO4M,Disgusting - product perchased in May but expired in Feb,Bought this product as a gift for my relative in Asia but was ashamed that was told by my receiver that it has been expired 3 months ago. It a waste of my money whereby I can't make refund due to product is not with me.
464584,B000UBD88A,"Good product, but prefer Keurig","I used to have a Keurig, but the pump went out twice, so I switched to Senseo. I prefer the Keurig and ended up buying a machine made by Cuisineart for Keurig cups in hopes that I won't have any pump problems."

9338,B006N3IG4K,Bland,"My husband likes strong coffee.  I like medium.  Neither one of us like this particular one.  There just isn't much flavor of any kind...coffee or caramel.  We like the vanilla one much better.  We'll drink this until it's gone...but it's the last flavor we choose, and it's lasting way too long!"
42513,B0029NS90E,Unhealthy,"The first ingredient isn't even a specific type of meat. It's meat broth. You have NO IDEA what it is. The first ingredient should always be a specific kind of meat, like Chicken. The second ingredient is Meat By-Product. That is the part of a meat, yet again not specified like it should be, that is not approved for human consumption. Like the beaks and legs of a chicken. Unhealthy! ALWAYS LOOK AT THE LABELS."
67357,B000928T3O,Tasteless,"Honestly.............I used to buy this frequently before they stopped caring it in my grocery store.  So I was actually quite excited to see its availibility online!  I'm not exactly sure what's up with it, but it has absolutely NO taste whatsoever......very big disappointment :o("
3008,B000B2PDKY,"Great aroma, and I don't like coffee","Bought as a Christmas present. Smells like a milk shake. I might have to try it, might make a coffee drinker out of me!"
57856,B000EVOSE4,Tasty Rubber,"I expected something softer in texture, but these are like chewing on rubber with flavor.  Much too hard for my 3 y/old child.  If you're looking for something tasty & softer in texture, try Kasugai Gummy Candies."
31856,B0062A87HA,"Can issue resolved? No problems with cans, just with texture","I was hesitant to order this because of the recurring complaint of damaged cans, but then noticed that those reviews seem less recent, and it looks like the shipping issue was resolved (I selected the ""Amazon Frustration-Free"" packaging).  The cans arrived in perfect condition, before their use-by date, etc.<br /><br />However, the texture of the pumpkin seems a bit off. We add the pumpkin to our dogs' food. Before buying this product, we typically used the large can of Libby's brand. The texture of this product is much firmer than the canned Libby's we were using, and it even looked like there was some congealed fat in the ""Farmer's Market"" can, which seems odd for pumpkin. Another difference is that it doesn't seem to be firming up our dogs' poop like the Libby's pumpkin did (sorry if TMI!). We will probably stick with Libby's once we finish the cans from this order."
2454,B002JX7GVM,New formulation for 10/2012 is not good at all!,Please contact the manufacturer and ask them to change back to the old formula if you love this product! We just cancelled our subscription of 8 cases per month because the new formula is disgusting! Not buying again unless the change back to the old version!

5057,B000E3ZFIK,Expires too soon,"These crackers are terrific, and they are priced right.  However, i ordered them on 10/29/06, and the expiration date on the box was 12/31/06.  We have only eaten four boxes.  They still taste fine after the expiration date, but... am i really expected to consume 12 boxes in 2 months?"
471,B000G6RYNE,"Good chips, more cheese","They are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut. I much prefer the salt & pepper just for the krinkle cut - they have a better texture. All around this brand is much better than Frito-Lay and a good price on Amazon when you get free shipping. These are similar to Tim's or Zack's chips in that they are very crispy.<br /><br />On a side note, these are the hardest bags to open by hand. I have to use a knife or scissors everytime."

16845,B001LGGH40,8.3 ounces of expensive mixed juice,"At around a buck a can, very expensive for 8.3 ounces of carbonated apple juice (with lesser amounts of grape juice, aceola whatever that is, raspberry juice, and finally actual strawberry and kiwi juice, plus some vitamin C added).<br /><br />With the 100% juice banner all over that can, you might be led to believe it's 100% strawberry/kiwi juice . . . it's not. Taste is not unlike a typical Strawberry soda pop, but not quite as good.  Expected sugar content (natural). 135 calories. I'm not likely to make future purchases of this one."
68841,B000H7ELTM,"The Best, Simply the Best!","I actually live in Michigan and every year head up to Traverse City for the cherry fest. It was during a cherry fest like 6-7 years ago that I was introduced to Traverse Bay dried fruits. I have never eaten another brand since. If you like dried fruit then look no further. Traverse Bay sells Dried Cherries, Dried Organic Cherries, Dried Organic Blueberries, Dried Wild Blueberries, Dried Red Raspberries, and Dried Strawberries. Just check out the companies homepage. They even offer subscription based shipping just like Amazon. They also sell a bunch of other stuff as well including antioxidant fruit based vitamins, Jams, fruit concentrates, etc..<br /><br />While dried cherries and dried cranberries are my favorites, I still really enjoy dried blueberries. I have actually tried a lot of different brands over the years and none of them have the quality, freshness and flavor that Traverse Bay has. I eat them out of the box, on cereal, in salads, and even in homemade ice cream. Dried blueberries, or any other dried fruit for that matter, is just a great snack.<br /><br />The bottom line - If your looking for high quality dried blueberries then look no further.<br /><br />5 Stars!"
116516,B002YJ0118,Excellent Product,"I got a popcorn maker for Christmas and after doing some research, I found this product. The key is the oil. Since than, I have ordered several boxes. It seems I always have popcorn on hand now. Once you try it, you will be sold."
41471,B00141QYSQ,Do Not Buy,"These are made in China (do not buy ANY pet food from China).  Dogswell has been using propylene glycol to soften their treats (what are they thinkng?).  Do not purchase or support this company in any way until they clean up their act.  And for whatever reason Amazon doesn't allow returns of this item, so I had to toss mine out.  Bad business all around on this one."
143461,B0007A0AQM,great training tool,"I use these to train my dog.  As others have pointed out, they smell awful.  Dogs love them though.  Not a lot of calories so you don't have to worry about your dog getting fat and sluggish either.  In fact, I break them up into two parts to get the most out of the bag."
306243,B001PCYJ4A,Help them grow,I use this product on my lemon (or orange) tree I grew from seed in a clay pot in my 11th floor apartment..  It is flourishing and I give this product part of the credit.

79590,B0041285XC,Starburst FaveRed,"For some reason, the stores have stopped selling this pack of starbursts, and it has been quite annoying.  I purchased this candy and have given them out to friends, and we are ALL quite happy."
6324,B000084EKW,MMMMMMMEEEEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWW...,"These Fancy Feast Variety Packs, which contain twenty-four cans, always ensure that you have a good supply of cat food on hand. I also do not have to waste my time stacking individual cans.  I always have a box of this one, the Gourmet Variety Pack, which is fish and seafood based, on hand. It contains eight cans each of ground ocean whitefish and tuna, salmon and cod, as well as sole and shrimp.<br /><br />I also always have on hand the Fancy Feast Sliced Variety Pack, which contains eight cans each of beef, chicken hearts and livers, and turkey. In addition, I also have a box of the Fancy Feast Grilled Variety Pack on hand, at all times, which contains eight cans each of grilled beef, turkey, and chicken, each in their own savory sauce. My cat, Mamushka,  loves them all."
154706,B0017U08M2,Pretty bad stuff...whew....,"I found the soup a bit too gritty and the flavor was not my cup of tea. It was a bit too smoke flavored for my taste also. My brother seems to like it so I would conclude ""different strokes for different folks""."
173491,B006N3I0N2,It really is Jazzed-up Decaf,This coffee has enough of a kick (despite being decaf) that I can brew a mug from one K-cup and it still has character.
114542,B0017I1QD4,not cheesey,this product is nothing like the white cheese sauce you get  in the southeast Us. there is no cheese taste at all  it has a vinegar flavor
7104,B004K30HO2,Great product,The pods worked as described.  I did not have overflows. I found the best way to secure the top is to press the raised area in the center of the top. Wish they were sold in larger quantities
10074,B003EML8PM,Lowrey's Microwavable Pork Rinds,"These were a great quick snack that did not raise my blood sugar level and you could sprinkle a variety of seasons to your taste preferences.  However, I chose to use the auto ship. Because of new health issues, I am unable to eat these anymore.  However because Lowrey's does not give you any option or information on how to cancel an order, I am forced to waste money buying these and having to toss them.  I hate to write this here, but maybe if they read it, they'll add the contact information.  Thank you."
277790,B002OMV09W,nothing grew,"Nothing grew i purchased 2 of these and both did not grow anything, i dont even know if seeds were in it since its packed with a bounch of stuff."
42181,B000633VBG,A Big Ripoff!,"I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. I ended up buying Blue Buffalo Wilderness and I have not looked back."
49410,B000IHNCQO,Barely Edible,"I was kind of excited about this product before it came in.  I found them in a little Atkins carb counter brochure, and thought I'd give it a shot.  I was very disappointed to find out that they do NOT taste like cheese crust. They taste like salted cardboard, but being I am sticking to this low carb thing, I do find myself eating them just for the crunch and the fact that I have already wasted $17 bucks on them."
7297,B0000V1B4I,Just like A.Js!,My whole family is addicted to this tea.  We make it in our Mr. Coffee Iced Tea Maker - it's fabulous!
534886,B003ZT25P6,They were out!,"Why am I getting emails from Amazon to review something I didn't get? They were out of this product, so there is nothing to review. I rated it one star because I had to rate it."
4367,B004391DK0,"Ah, finally some good-ol' dumplings!!","I was amazed to find this on the shelf of my favorite grocer (sorry to say, cheaper than it is sold here, even with subscribe and save....).  First thing I made was my childhood favorite - dumplings - and they were just like I remembered them to be!  The whole family was happy with them - they were such a big hit!  I can't wait to make blueberry muffins this summer.  I have never been able to duplicate the taste of Bisquick with any other gf recipe, and no other recipe for blueberry muffins is quite the same, in my opinion.<br /><br />Thank you, General Mills!"
79068,B001EPPIT8,"Bits and pieces, very salty","My packages came with tiny pits and pieces. :-(  Not one piece was bigger than my thumb nail.  The picture is deceiving.  The texture is good, but the overly salty flavor seems like it actually masks the taste of salmon.  And believe me I LOVE SALTY foods, which is why i was drawn to this.  I would not order this again because only the color resembled salmon, the rest was too small and salty to tell.  Very disappointed."
3808,B000X2CWTM,All Natural Licorice Can't be beat,I have been eating Panda Licorice for a number of years and it is hard for someone who loves licorice to eat any other brand.  This is all natural (which is what makes it taste great) from the licorice root.  Fresh always because of the unique packaging and the most flavorful.
90785,B006G7XV7A,not so good,this is my fav Jerkey of all time..and when i recived mine it was moist and not good..the jerky still had white fat visable on the jerky it was so moist it was sticky..if you now this brand u know thats not how its supposed to be..i even threw out 2 bags it was that bad..idk y or how it happened but i wont buy it online ever again..Gl

She can eat absolutely anything and everything and is always getting into my ""human"" food and has never thrown up.

I didn't connect it at first but when I gave her the same treats the next day, exact same reaction!<br /><br />I have tried several different flavors of this same brand and she has had the same reaction! If you are trying these with your cat for the 1st time, only give them 1 of them and just wait to see how they react before you give them anymore."
502646,B000W7V7BM,these taste awesome,move over chili cheese frito's because these corn nuts just knocked you out with flavor.
1540,B000E7WM0K,Not so much...,"We enjoy A Taste of Tai's Peanut Noodles... they rock.  That peanutty flavor...mmm... so we decided to try these... um, Ginger, not so much. Nothing really distinguishes these from any other noodle flavor, and the ginger is a bit overpowering.<br /><br />Take this review in stride though, if you're a Ginger lover (and I'm not talking Gilligan's Island here), then these may be right up your alley.  Just a bit outside for me, though (if I may mix my metaphors)."
556419,B000FP0JY2,Fracaso total!,"Mi gato no le hace caso en lo mas minimo, se lo apliqu&eacute; en su juguete y nada de nada, no se puso loco, ni corri&oacute; como decia el producto.<br />No se si se deba a que mi gato tiene 8 a&ntilde;os y ya no le interesa o que pasa, la verdad no entiendo.<br />Ahora no se que hacer con el producto."
6635,B001LG945O,Bubble liquid,"Although some may like this drink, it will not be a repeat buy for me.  140 calories for an 8+ oz serving is too much when that amount of orange juice is 115.  Actually this drink isn't 100% orange/tangerine juice, but a mix of juices.  Secondly, if this were unaltered juice, seems you wouldn't have to add ascorbic acid to get 100% of your daily Vitamin C since that amount of orange juice naturally provides over 150%. Perhaps the processing requires it. But, alas, the biggest issue for me was taste.  It tasted to me like dishwashing liquid smells.<br /><br />On the good side, the carbonization is just right and the flavor is bold for those who seek that.  There is no sugar added and the non-traditional taste is not overly sweet.  The taste may appeal to some, but I'm not a fan."
4088,B001EW5YQS,Works great :),"It does what it says. I was only worried that either it wouldn't be compatible with my mic, or that my computer wouldn't recognize it, but everything turned out great. It's plug and play, my computer (running Windows 7) instantly recognized it and I was able to use this right away (in less than 5 minutes from unboxing it).<br /><br />It seemed like a joke to me at first, because it is so small and lightweight, so I thought it wouldn't actually supply Phantom Power or something like that, but it actually does, so this is pretty great. What I love most about this is that it is extremely portable and easy to set up, I DEFINITELY recommend this."
79158,B002P6FSVS,Far too expensive.,I have to say I'm quite a fan of Ramune soda.....just not at this price. I know there should be a store SOMEWHERE wherever you might live that sells this soda or just some other online store. It's just not worth it at this price. Even if you were using amazon.com credit (which I am) I wouldn't waste my money on this. It's a shame.

284,B000H13270,Rotel saves me on a daily basis,"I use the Rotel Mild and I LOVE this product so much--it saves me on a daily basis.  If you're trying to cook lower fat, healthier foods and in a HURRY, this stuff makes it so much easier.  Ever notice that some canned tomatos have a weird ""tin can"" taste when you make spagehetti sauce or whatever?  For some reason this product doesn't have that.  It tastes so good you can just dump it in with a can of beans, heat and eat.<br /><br />or add some chili powder and now you have chili soup.  I also make indian dishes with this, and spicey spaghetti sauce.  I also prefer this to most canned salsas, so it works for things like quesadillas if you drain the liquid off.<br /><br />None of my local grocery stores carry it at all, nor do they carry anything like it.  So I have to pay Amazon's inflated price to order this by the case.  I don't like that I'm paying a higher price, but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the product."
43247,B005DDC3JK,Great!,"I must say I was a bit skeptical and little hesitant to purchase this product after reading other reviews. We are usually a Jiff only family. However, this came up on sale, so I decided to give it a try. FANTASTIC!!! It is not oily and weak as others have stated. The product we received was very rich and flavorful. I actually prefer over Jiff now. The kids raved about it."
344074,B008J1HO4C,Good Stuff,"Tasty AND nutritious; what's not to like?  But what's with all the griping about the cans?  Who gives a damn about cans, anyway?"
238942,B001396HQS,Happy Dog,My dog LOVES this food. He follows us around at meal time till he gets his food and then never leaves his dish till it's gone.
19663,B0030VBRIU,They call this baby food!?!?,"My 1 year old will eat anything...well that was until I gave him Happybaby Gobble Gobble. Immediately when I opened the package I was turned off by it. It looked and smelled awful...this does not look like tastey baby food at all. Against my better judgement, I still let my son try it. The first bite he choked and gagged. I thought, ""ok, it's just too thick"". So I thinned it out with a bit of formula and tried again. Second bite he spit it out and tried to scrape off what was left on his tongue with his fingers! My son is NOT a picky eater by any means and loves food in general, so I knew this MUST be awful if he wouldn't eat it. Rather than torture my kid, I threw the rest out. Thankfully I had only purchased two pouches at the store before commiting to a pack of 16 on Amazon. If only I had read the reviews first!<br /><br />Bottom line, don't torture your kid with this OR waste your money!"
35174,B001ATMQK2,Have you seen how much Ranch 99 is trying to charge!!,"I bought this 6 pack because for the price that my local Ranch 99 was trying to charge, I could buy 3 through Amazon.  Product is identical and managed to save tons of money on sauce I use on everything."
5188,B003R0LKSG,Happy Cats,"I have 5 house cats.  One was recently diagnosed with diabetes.  We got his diabetes under control with insulin but I began researching diet information to help us.  All of my research led us to try Felidae grain free.  I spent two weeks carefully switching Louis (and the four girls) from dry Iams to Felidae.  I was immediately able to decrease his insulin and by the time I had him totally on Felidae we were able to discontinue insulin totally.  All with our veterinarian's supervision, a consistent feeding schedule and measured amounts. (It has not been effortless but it has been worthwhile.) Louis has been insulin free for two weeks now.  All five cats (ages 5 to 19) love the food.  Their stools are good, their coats look wonderful & they haven't vomited for weeks. YAY!"
46747,B000OF9NG8,Stale Cookies,"We love the Stella D'Oro Anisette Toast cookies.  For some reason, they are no longer stocked in our local stores.  So, we have resorted to ordering them on line.  This last shipment, in boxes,  expiring Dec. 2009,  are stale and hard.  Every box. One of the boxes had a hole in the plastic inner wrap.  I really miss our Anisette toast.  How can we get them fresher.<br /><br />Very disappointed,  Jacqueline W."

119007,B001SIU13O,Dog refuses to eat,That should tell you something about the quality of this product. I switched her to California Naturals immediately after seeing her literally turn her nose up at this brand. She took to CA Naturals and loves the food.

1152,B0017WFN4S,Like tiny light flavored peanut halves....,"Excellent in cereal, or on top icecream sundae. I use them in my ramen noodle hot/sour soup as well.  very very GOOD.  almost a lite peanut flavor.  not too much salt, very lightly seasoned. a must try for anyone wanting a low calorie addition of protien into diet.  even the dog loves them. thinks they are some special treat."
8408,B003VXFK44,Just okay,"I like dark strong coffee but I just didn't really care for this one.  Not sure what it really was, almost a tad bitter?  Unfortunately I have another whole box of 24 to use up.  I picked up some Sumatran Reserve (also a dark) and prefer it."
7563,B002UQ7NP2,It's GREAT!,"I am a fan of the Bellini drink, white peach puree and Prosecco (a Italian sparkling wine) and I was NOT disappointed.  I mainly brew it for ice tea.  I disagree with some of reviewers in that not only do you taste the raspberries and peaches you can also taste the sparking wine.  This is my primary drink in the summer.  To give it a little kick I will sometimes add a peach liquor or peach flavored rum.  I recommend it highly"

There is no part of me that's tempted to replace my morning routing with a can of this, easy as it might be.<br /><br />Really, it wasn't horrible. It tasted an awful lot like the other big brand's version of this, which, unfortunately (and I know this sounds horrible), tastes to me like, well, like coffee smells when it's exiting the body. Maybe this is just me, but it's something of a turn-off, and is true for both that other brand and for this one.<br /><br />I didn't really enjoy the texture of this drink, either -- kind of syrupy and thick, when it seems like without cream it should be pretty watery. It was also waaaay sweeter than I would ever want my coffee to be, but given that I generally prefer an unsweetened cold coffee, I'm not sure how much stock you want to put in that.<br /><br />Overall, if you like that other brand's version of this product, I don't see why you wouldn't like this, but if you're hoping for something better -- I don't think this is it."
67474,B003T0W5LK,My Error,"This was shown next to the same product in a 3 pack but not Amazon Prime. The prices were almost identical but the other had a $10 shipping fee. I believed I was ordering a three pack. I got a one pound can for $12.64 that I could have bought for less in my local supermarket! Caveat Emptor, Let the Buyer Beware!<br />Guess I got hosed on this one. Has happened before I must remember to read the whole page befor placing orders. Even then you do not always get what was pictured."
17201,B006JG8ALK,Wonderful but better refrigerate...,"These bars are just the right balance between the flavor of the coconut & the sweetness of the rice syrup. Unfortunately, although the expiration date is in 2013, about a third of mine went bad, or perhaps started life that way. They had a funny, metallic taste, & one even had some black substance on it, which may or may not have been mold. I'm wondering if refrigerating would have prevented this. I highly recommend these bars, but beware of the keeping quality!"
29891,B005VOOQLO,horrible taste,This stuff tastes like the pink soap in a a gas station bathroom smells.<br /><br />Yuck.<br /><br />I threw the whole bottle away after two tastes.  I only took the second taste to see if it really tasted as bad as it did.
1782,B001RVFDOO,absolutely delicious,I love these chips so much... and I can't get over how delicious each variety is!! The price here is AWESOME too!
